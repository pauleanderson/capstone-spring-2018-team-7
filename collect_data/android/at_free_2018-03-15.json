        "This game is great but for some reason the game won't let one if my sims stay married to another sim, I've had them get married 4 times and I've even had a wedding party by when I closed the game and started playing ut they were no longer married, although the party was still going on which makes no sense. I've had to have them get engaged 9 times and even though it doesn't save that they get engages it for some reason saves the relationship points. It doesn't bother me that much but I would like to know how to fix it or for there to ve an update to fix it. Other than that this game is one of the most fun I've played in a while and I love it, this is truy a fun game.",
        "It's a great game but it could be better. I wanted it to be more like TheSims 4 and Freeplay. I wish we could do more with our sims. I would like more control on what they get to do. Right now, i just find myself keeping my sims at work because thats basically the only action they can do in the game. I dont really have time add on to my home because making money takes forever unless you buy packages. It would be nice if they could earn more money as they progress in their careers. I hope in the future they will add more features and make it more enjoyable.",
        "As with all previous sims games is fantastically interactive and a true enjoyment to play however Electronic Arts and Mavis have fallen into the Play Store down fall and advertising as free to play but trying to get players to buy items of in the game to progress faster. I'm sure like many others this is a great annoyance to me and I'd rather pay a one-off price to play the game as I see fit then spend copious amounts to advance by buying Sim's cash and simoleons! Please sort it out and make this game great again!",
        "It is OK,  however it is not what the game was letting on. It's more of like a game like Simpson tapped out or something. Like any mobile game, actions take hours to complete and you have energy that can run out stopping you from being able to play for a while. This is EA's way of getting you to buy their over priced boosts. But it is not bad, it is fun and enjoyable, and it is cool to design your sims and construct your own house. I also kinda like the feature that you can buy new clothes rather than using the simple clothing you can wear at the beginning of the game. Overall it is fun and enjoyable, but it doesn't feel like a sims game",
        "Update 10.3.2018: So far so good, I'm getting more familiar with the controls and stuff. The only concern for now is whenever I play for extended period of time, like 20-30 mins, my device's temperature kept on increasing and it's quite uncomfortable to hold. I wish the devs can optimise the game better for older devices, I'm using Honor 5X with the Snapdragon 616 btw...",
        "I love the sims. Been playing it since I first had a computer. When this ame got release I was excited and its fun and i have my fiance playing the game too. However, i can no longer progress through the different careers, hobby, and relationships. im stuck at level 7 and wont give me the option to perform events. Please fix or share details on how to progress."

        "It's a pretty good game for just short periods of time like waiting in line. It's a good online game you play with other people although the connections are not the greatest. Controls are sometimes not that great because sometimes there is a nice open play on one side of the field and your character passes it into a field of defenders. I think the game passes where it sees the most players on your team, it does not care about how many defenders are over there. It's not my top game I've ever played, but I would recommend it for a every once in a while game.",
        "This game is absolutely awful. Everything is so luck based. There is no skill involved in this game whatsoever. If you're lucky and have a big wallet you'll be top on the leaderboards. The tackling is dreadful, only based around luck, the passing is based around luck, the dribbling is based around luck and the shooting is terrible. There is nothing redeeming about this game at all. The gameplay itself isn't fun and you should definitely avoid this game at all costs.",
        "The idea's good, as it was in Score and Score Hero, but it has several flaws. No offline (vs AI) mode. Can't discard/delete reward boxes, you have to open them (time-locked, or spend cash). Can't cancel tackle, despite having an activation delay. Can't control goalie saves (except in penalty shoots). If it had all that, it'd be a 5 star game.",
        "Good game but frame rate drops really low quite often and it uses way too much battery. Checking battery status reported it had used 6% of a full charge after only 37mins. Feels like some finishing off is needed but this game is brilliant. I'm playing this on a Pixel 2.",
        "Edit - frame rate is a shambles since the update. The opposition now doesn't even need to pause or stop to play the next move. Not even worth a download. Shocking how this was even released. Good game but poor execution. The logic is there but it always favours the opposition. Simple moves can't be pulled off but can by the opposition. You draw a perfectly straight line and the ball follows a completely different path.",
        "Great game Not pay to win Recommend it to everyone Please add these features-- 1- add friend option        So that we can be friend with whoever we play 2 -create a clan mode      Where player can play Team with most points win 3- add one more storage P.s-Thanks for developing this game"

On my upgrades, I have XP level 270 and have a 138% Chance for golden apples. However, since the update I haven't seen a single golden apple. Why is this? It's not too big of a problem as I have enough apples to buy all of the knives again 5x, but I like the satisfaction of seeing all of the golden apples when I play. Also, I have a 270% Bonus Prize apples and when I open the free gift, it only gives me 100% bonus. Again this isn't a problem but I would like to see the highest amount of apple's I have earned. Thanks I enjoy a lot of your games Ketchapp! Leopard up the good work!!!",

But now that I have unlocked all the bats I have nothing to do, we need more content apart from new bats. We need to have more than just 15 bats added per update, we want objectives, maybe switch up the gameplay a little. More substance is required.",
        "It's a cool idea, a fun game overall. It is absolutely FULL of advertisements, which are on the bottom of the screen, and which open every single time I finish my round. I get that Voodoo needs to make money and that advertisements are perfect for that, but not so many! Also takes a very long time to load for me, circa 2 minutes. I don't know if this might be an issue with my phone, but I still am not too happy with this game!",
        "Its a good time-killing game. I get that free games get a lot of their revenue through ads but this is crazy. For the amount of user input to play this game (which is like 3 taps on the screen) you get about 2 minutes of ads for about 40-60 seconds of gameplay. Between every hit is a 30 second ad. But still for a free game its addictive.",
        "1 star rating there's entirely too many ads.  I understand you need ads for revenue but this is too much.  You will learn the hard way that gamers do not like over the top.  1 star also because you have to click multiple x's to exit the ad.  Even then some ads ignore that you clicked X and take you to a site anyway.  RIP this game in 4 months tops.",
        "Game itself is cute and I bet that with some effort you could make it more fun than it already is but..... WAY TOO MANY ADS. change it or stay with 1 star  Edit: it even forces you to watch ads in order to upgrade! What the actual f....",
        "The game is fine, could actually be fun to play if it weren't for the excessive amount of ads. It's completely understandable to have some ads (e.g. the one at the bottom of the screen, or giving the player the option to double their money by watching an ad) but to force the player into watching an ad after every 3 rd play seems quite unreasonable. I played the game for 5 minutes and had to watch 4 ads. Again I understand you need to make your money and ads are a way to go but not that many. Maybe tone it down a bit and increase the payout for viewing ads."

        "I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn't working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn't show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.",
        "Its a unique interesting style of game. I did enjoy it. My only complaint is that it has a ton of ads if you have to restart a level. To remove the ads is 3.99 While I understand the developers have to make money in this game and that is how they do it, I don't have any money to pay for games on my phone. Other than that its an enjoyable game",
        "Good concept. Too bad the ads ruin the calibration. Either the ad loads and is in the way or it doesn't load and shifts the page. This second issue is the worst of the two. This completely ruins the calibration and forces you to touch above or below the tile you want to remove. Often times leading you to remove tiles you don't want to",
        "Sadly, it could've been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.",
        "There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen",
        "Nice concept, but like others have said the tapping is off. You have to tap half a cm above the block you want to pop. No wonder you advertise \"Only 1% of players make it to 10,000!\""

        "This game was practically stolen from Piano Tiles 2, even the sounds and they copied the design terribly. Sure, they bring new things that are different from Piano Tiles, but it's done terribly. The one thing I saw different was the bar at the bottom and getting the actual score, but after more playing, I realised that the bar was just there so they could sync up the music with when the blocks would come to the bar. They didn't even at least sync up the music to when you hit the black boxes, I experimented. All in all the game is terrible because of my own experiences and things they didn't do very correctly.",

Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I love this game. Been playing since almost the beginning. Idk how I feel about the ultimate league but it's not bad. I'm digging the concept of the kings part of the gang fights. I'd really like it if you guys could have it show who's online in your gang like it does in the championship lobby. Oh and notifications for your gang chat would be great. I'm seeing comments about the game crashing, and heard issues my gang has had also. Hopefully that's taken care of soon. It would be nice to hear back on this comment to know we're being heard. Thanks",
        "Cute, simple, fun to compete. Strong presence of Pay-2-Win when Tier-1 players are 1-shotting you. Can advance timers by watching ads so use wifi often. **Dropped a star because I can't do this anymore; it's only asking for gems now**. Clubs (gangs) only hold 25 people and cost 100 gems to start. Need Bolts to upgrade, chests to get them, 2h-6h to unlock or watch 2-12 ads (not anymore for me?) So grind while playing games or watching movies.",
        "I very much enjoy this game because it is a lot of fun and us very exiting to play. Not only are you able to fight different people online, but you also get to customise you're vehicle. And you get to chose what your character's outfit looks like.",
        "I truly love this game and would give it five stars...if only it would give me items that are in my tier, get to tier four finally get tier one weapons of the same class. I like a challenge but this is absurd stupidly absurd",
        "Game was fun. Then I started hitting the wall where you couldn't progress unless you paid more money. Then this most recent patch introduced a bunch of bugs that kept losing parts and golden tix. Then their support was unresponsive. Not fun anymore."

        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it.",
        "I love this game as it's challenging but not ridiculously hard! Very addictive & u can get coins & power ups within the game, 2 help u, so there's no need 2 buy any! 🤗 Pity more games aren't like that!! 😊",
        "Great so far but the point systems seems completely pointless. Only shows you your score when you've completed the level so you've got no idea how the game calculates it, you just get a score and a few stars. Great style, music and animations though.",
        "I have been playing games forever. This is the first time I've thrown away  my brain to play such pathetic genre of game. But it is slightly engaging. I can see why so many idiots love it. 🎓",
        "This game is very addictive, also relaxing and time certainly flies by when playing. The main issue is the cost of any extras, where did the prices come from. 2 full packs and you can buy a proper games console with games, just let that sink in. Absolutely ridiculous cost that will stop anyone from purchasing. Shame to spoil what is a great game.",
        "Just feel S though after you get to a certain level more extra hammers and gloves and dice should be given. More than one is not enough and then paying a lot of money for extra moves is ridiculous but I enjoy the game so much its like I have no choice lol. Other than that it's a great and addictive game. Great job"

And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon.

The best i liked was that our cats which we use in battle and are able to survive come back to us only and we can use it next time also because in other games like cladh of clans our troops which we have used and survived are just wasted. Moreover the graphics and gameplay is also nice..🖒🖒🖒🖒",

I finished them all in 10 minutes and I really liked them but there are no more now and I need a challenge. Thank you for this game. Also, the manual transmission is very unpractical, please change that. One thing that would be nice is to have more camera angles. Or a 360° view when you swipe on the screen.",

        "Latest update: The agressive pop up ads are gone and have been replaced by video ads. Even when connected to mobile data services. I wouldn't say this is an improvement. Draining my data volume for advertisement is not nice. It's just greedy. This app is producing so much money anyways, why video ads? Wouldn't normal images be enough?  Update: The agressive advertisement is back and it's worse than ever. There are huge amounts of unauthorised browser popups partly midgame and even when the app is simply running in the background. This needs to be addressed!  Earlier: I like this app a lot. The concept behind it is great and it's great fun to play. The questions are mostly balanced aside from the annoyingly football heavy sports category. Lately though the app kept opening up dubious websitest, usually at the beginning of a round. This is absolutely untolerable (!). It should not have the permission to do this. I've been hoping for the latest fee updates to fix this - they didn't.",

        "I love the game. Been loving it for years. I've been noticing alot lately though that when I watch the ad video to double up on my mystery box, it's not doubling my prize. Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "The game is cool, however its doesnt always move to the lwft oe the right when swipe. A lot of times it will continue to go straight which causes me to die. I know its the game because its when I'm about to pick up something important or jump at a crucial point. Also this ismy 3rd phone and it does it on all phones. This error needs to be fixed.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "I am beyond upset, I had about 50 keys and more than 8k in coins. I spent all my time simply doing tasks, daily missions, and much more to get to where I was far in the game. When I logged back on, it showed I was logged in still but I have lost my keys and my coins, it reset EVERYTHING and it even did the whole intro for the beginners. I don't understand what happened.",
        "This game is amazing but I would add that  each game you get a key and lots of coins. Also some people might be playing in a different country than America and they would like to buy something but they don't have dollars 💵 I LOVE THE GAME",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters"

The 5 free hints is unrecoverable like other puzzle games that I played! Also sometimes the games shows some ads, even worst player are force to watch ads just to unlock certain levels! Do yoy what more garbage is? The puzzle dont make a senses, with limited once 5 free hints, every each puzzles  are pretty stupid as they are not logical (even you want make a troll still need to make its logic like other puzzle games).",

        "Its amazing!!!! I wanted fort nite but even if i deleted everything i have, i still would not be able to get it. It costs sooo much room. With this game, i can have roblox,color switch, and at least 100 pictures and 10 videos, AND still have room for it. This the best shooting game i have ever had! And i have played gta and call of duty. So that says a lot. It is also very fair. U dont get a increase on anything when wearing special clothing. So new comers could be just as good as people at lvl 100. I would deffenety recemend it.",
        "Look into the option to enalble driving like KNIVES OUT etc. When one uses a gamepad, player can choose the setting where u can use the two joysticks to drive vehicles. Now after mapping the keys , there r no more space or option to drive. Hope u listen, gamers are improving n evaluating your game for you n its FREE !",
        "Ok this game is the best battle Royale game I played and I've played all of them. This is smooth and fun and different. But you need to keep adding on the game please cause I love it. Add more guns like a lot. More snipers and possibly a big gun and more pistols and just everything lol. And maybe add some more places on the map. And one more thing, add 100 players to fight if you can",
        "For all this time I only played girly game like The Sims, Temple Run, etc but I decided to give this game a shot earlier today. GOD how I wish I tried it earlier! This is like the best game I've played in years, it's super playable even for someone like me (who have never played this kind of games before) and I just cant believe just how much this game has to offer! The graphic is flawless, no bugs or errors at all, the control is perfect, and it's superrr realistic. This game reminds me of Hunger Game lol. I feel emotionally exhausted while playing this game because I was always in a state of running and surviving. Very recommended!",
        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "The best game I've ever played on mobile without a doubt. The features are insane, really shows you how far mobile gaming has come.  Can't really put into words how good this game really is for a mobile game! Would recommend adding the Facebook page and joining the group on Facebook because you learn tricks and funny glitch spots in the game where you can hide to rack up some kills  Great game. Can't wait for the new map extensions"

        "This app is awesome! I'm OCD so I have tried many of these. Most want you to pay for pics. Not this one! Some show locked, but you click it & watch a short ad & get the pic! Each day 1 or more new pics are added. I have colored all 673. Then opened it today & found an update. Have not tried it yet, but 3D & loading in your own pics was added. I did load 1 in quick, just to see how easy it was. Loaded in great & I can't wait to color it! 78 new pics were added, most 3D. I'm excited to try the new update. I look forward to my 1 notification each day to say the new daily pics are up. Finally, a company that doesn't want you to pay, pay, pay!! Btw... I find it easier to color big areas with the magnifying glass off in the settings. I would install more from this company if I could find any! Keep up the great work! Thank you for an awesome app that helps calm my OCD's!!!",
        "I absolutely love this app for passing some time. The only issue I have with it is it's very hard to precisely pick a color from the color bar and/or start a color-by-dragging operation without instead starting a scroll operation. This is even more true on the new 3D pictures. You need to add a 2-4 pixel dead-zone before initiating a scroll/rotate.",
        "Needs better options. For example, if you don't want to do the 3D puzzles, a way of scrolling thru 2D only, separate than 3D. Also, should remove art from \"library\" list once completed, that way only the art that's available to work on is in that list. Right now everything is on one massive list. Need to scroll thru 200+ art work to finds the one yet to do",
        "I absolutely loved this app. I was totally addicted but the new update the 3d twist is horrible and super annoying. I hate skipping pics and all went in orser. I wish you could choose between the two but for now ill just skip them all. The ads have gotten worse lately but I do love the app so much!!",
        "I love the game, it just a relacing, no brainer type game that is instant stress relief.  My only negative is that I paid to remove the adverts, which isn't cheap only to find that for some puzzles you still have to sit through 30 seconds of mind numbing dross to play them.  The removal of the ads should remove the need for ALL ads.",
        "The 2D aspect of this app is excellent. The new 3D aspect on the other hand is extremely wonky--you darn near have to pound on your phone screen to get a short tap to even register, and good luck on getting long taps to even work right. Rated 4 stars only because of the 3D aspect. The 2D aspect is perfect, and I plan to stick with that."

After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "If you deploy a troop that hasn't got a primary target never, and I mean never, does cover the least space possible. It always goes with those weird angles for just an easy target. Just go straight forward.. Cover a line, we don't need unnecessary last moment turns. I play this game since 2013 with different accounts but this thing stays the same. Plz fix it",
        "It was a wonderful game . Thank u SUPERCELL ,for giving us a wonderful game. This game graphics was awesome. But I have a complaint against u. That is : if you update this game's features , from where can we get memory. We don't have that much memory in our phones.        Just joking....... Your updates were also awesome. Hope u provide us many games like this coc"

        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!",
        "Good game I figured out why I couldn't buy the bikes anymore😹 Anyway sometimes it gets a bit laggy but it doesn't last for to long. I told my friends about it and they love it it's fun to play when you're bored. All in all a good game:) Edit: Game:Score between 54 and 58 me: *scores 54* yes! *waiting* Game: doesn't count Me: great."

        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "I think it is a great game but i do not like the controls. Yes i know it is meant to be a run but i think it could have a  more traditional Mario controls. The graphics is pretty good. The difficulty could be turned down as the Bowser level is always taking me another 2 days to unlock aft finishing norm lvls. And lastly, i think u could make the village livelier.",
        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "This game had great potential and did well with it. Just because there's that wall of 10$ to pay isn't that bad. You had to pay much more when New Super Mario Bros Wii came out (If you bought it). I really like the graphics and how you are challenged to get newer characters like Daisy, Toadette, or even Luigi. 👌👌👌"

        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",

It is it's for those people who are like super bored and they would do something like musically something that they can do that because they can play Magic titles to it is so much fun and it's it's amazing and awesome I can't stand it and going to go fast with the baby dolls and bears its cool good",
        "One of my favourites from cheetah, however, on certain devices the games sound seems to get altered on certain keys making the game very unsatisfying to play. However, on my Samsung the game is a joy, I am using a Sony experia right now so I guess it's only on certain devices, but I feel like the alternative sound should be optional. 9/3/2018 I'm so glad that the game has recently updated and the noise issue has been resolved, the game is as lovable as it was before if not more!",
        "It's really REALLY fun and addicting. I absolutely love it. The only thing I don't really like about it is that you only have a certain amount of lives. But other than that, this game is AWESOME and I mean awesome when I say AWESOME. You should totally download it, I really recommend it!!",
        "Been playing this game for years and I still love it. New songs are being added regularly and it's easy enough to get gems to unlock them. Ads aren't distracting and micro transactions are limited to those too impatient. Great designs. 10/10",
        "I do like the game but the problem is whenever I do a song and pick the snow powerup, I can't activate it. I always press the icon but it's not working and it's making me fail more. Please put the snow powerup in some place else, and also maybe make it biter for a finger."

        "Well I've played this game since it lunched and I love the game but I will give it 2 stars because after every update I am getting ridiculous amount of lag that it causes the game to become unplayable. I can't even land on the ground anymore 7 of 10 matches it locks me in the air and I cant even land and the other 3 of 10 I die because of lag. This issue become real after season 1 started I didn't have such problem in season 0 and my phone is perfectly fine for this game too. I will give it higher rating after this issue is gone. Thanks",
        "Wow, you just did it in the starting update banning cheaters but after a month cheaters were back.. What?! It makes the game ruined and shamed because cheaters are still there. So please do your move to get rid of the cheaters. I love this game but it lacks security hack please improve",
        "I got some problem. My device cannot see the 'ground' when its near enough. It span at least for 1 or 2 km and i can see through the 'ground' i can also see trees, bushes, stones and buildings on top of high ground which usually blocked by ground. And that make matters more worse, u can see players walking around on top of hill when im from the bottom",
        "Good Job Developers. Firstly the gaming is really awesome. The graphics is good according tho Phones. But Need some more updates and correction. 1. Add all Best weapons of the world. 2. Ban the cheaters. 3. Add talking feature to Enemy also like in PUBG. 4. Real physics of driving. 5.Add some simplicity in controls but advance. 6.Free diamonds to those who doesn't get that yet.",
        "ONE WORD LAAGGG!! The game would be very good if I could move 2 steps without lagging. The developers are adding new and uncalled for features in every update, rather than improving the gameplay. The game used to be better before all these updates. Disappointed.",
        "ROS is laggy in Android. I'm using a quad core and 3GB phone and yet it still laggy (even at lowest graphic setting). I'm able to play other network games (e.g. Free Fire Battlegrounds at Ultra Setting) without this lag (so my network connection is okay). This makes it not enjoyable to play. :("

I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don't open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.",
        "NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a \"quick paste first place!\" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I've loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I'm a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who's Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don't use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖"

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "Why would someone only play one round of this fun game? Install this game to find out.  Hint: greedy developers like to hit you with multiple ADs between every attempt. These one-off games are only an attempt to be the next Flappy Bird, but with the most annoying implementation of AD serving.",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "I just paid the money to remove the ads, but there are still ads. It just gets rid of the long ones. Money wasted. Much better games are out there. Good luck getting a refund also. Since it is an in-app purchase, you have to get it from the developer. I'll go leave 1 star reviews for their other apps... what a great scam they have going here."

Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",

        "Love this game! I have been playing Gardenscapes for quite some time and I would see ads for this one. So I decided to try it. Now I am hooked! However, I wish it was like Matchington Mansions where you can go to other players mansions and if they have items that you don't have (furniture, flooring, wallpaper etc.) you can click on it and acquire it. Not sure if this game has that option because I am not that far along in the game. Other than that, it is FANTASTIC!!",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Everything is awesome. Love the gameplay, love the graphics and  etc. BUT please can ypu speed the \"end stage\" part?  I am talking about the part where you finished the stage and you start collecting the  coins.  Can you speed it up? Because watching my 7+ moves turn into airplanes or bombs and watch how they make more money is good but its taking too long.  Especially  when I have an infinite life's  for hour or so.  Can you make so that after you finish the stage it will simply fast forward to the end?  Thank you",
        "It's a nice game alright - lovely graphics and a nice gameplay. But I can't help thinking that it was made for one single purpose - to pull money out of your pocket. The levels are too hard, the moves are never enough so you either have to give up and loose a life or pay for additional moves. Such a shame, I really liked it but I will have to delete it.",
        "This game left me speechless at how incredibly fascinating it was. Some may say that it's just another candy crush saga, but this game is in a whole other league & is more than just matching colors. There is not a single defect in this game. Although, honestly speaking, at 1st it didn't look all that great in the ads I would see of it, but I thought since I continued to see it quite often that I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did because this is one of the GREATEST Mobile games EVER MADE! For me it would easily be top 3 Hands down. I would strongly recommend this to any & everyone. I only wish I were able to grant this Marvelous game 6 Stars."

You made the game very 2 dimensional by removing the acceleration boost you get from doing flips like you had in the first game, not to mention you also dumbed down the contols. You shouldve kept the original style of the first one. Mad Skillz BMX is one of the only reasons i keep my tiny ipod touch around.",

ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it's a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz",

        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "They should call the game Cooking Fever Lite just because that is honestly what you get with this game. Fun and addictive in the beginning, but eventually you realize the grind for gems has low yield and is largely chance based, and the rate of growth for your restaurants significantly lessens. It drains the appeal if you're looking for a fun freebie."

The game has totally become pay to win .Guyz make some improvement.Dont just earn money through game.Gameinsight should  decrease  gold cost of gold  weapons.And also introduce new assault and shotguns without including any event. Make those new year guns available soon and dont keep its gold cost higher than juggernaut coz its fire rate is damn slow .Plz after reading this review make  changes in game .This will not only benefit players but also your company in increasing your game lovers and customers.",
        "Hate the multiple control point matches. Rewards are way, way, WAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too low considering how incredibly expensive weapons and upgrades are. You win, you get 30 trophies. You lose, you lose 60. They welcome hackers/cheaters into the game. You pay real money for gold and upgrades, you are guaranteed wins and quick 0 hit kills. 100% pay to win. Greedy. No more from me.",
        "Not sure why people are saying this as a bad game and all.  I loved it and recommended it to some of my friends also. They also loved it.  Game is online multiplayer mode and even if you didn't like it in the first 10-15 minutes, give it some more time and u'll definitly keep playing it.",
        "Don't waste your time or money! Game needs serious rebalancing, later game guns feel powerless against ridiculous tank-like armor and headshots mean almost nothing! Would give the game a better review if at least headshots dealt more damage."

I'm already making lots of gold with automating raspberries. Raspberries give away so much gold. Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game. Look under the review! There're many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 100,000 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.",
        "On my top 5 Favorite games EVER! And my only one on mobile! The double of fine gold is awesome! a  I have probably spent 20min on ads lol! A few recommendations though. Can you have a warning if you will spend more than 50% of your gold on coin upgrades. Also i dont like having the duplicates for the boxes! One more is to have a stats area! I love the farmer upgrades and the easy progression of the game! I do love the different crops also!",
        "Yet another clicker game that I said I'd never play again. This one's done quite well. Although, it seems that when you farm puppies you're chopping their heads of?!! Expect to play it constantly for 2 weeks then uninstall when you're asking yourself what is the point in this.",
        "Fun and easy to play, perfect way to pass time. Sometimes it seems that you don't get the points when harvesting tho. Example: the total was 17.04m and I harvested 500k and the total didn't change even tho it should have been 17.54, seemed to happen frequently which slows down your progress.",

        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",
        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "\"Cusion shot on 8 ball\" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.",
        "Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It's also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app."

        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "There is not enough options to choose from when placing stuff in your garden and the hard levels should give you two stars and the really hard levels should give you three stars. Also the further you make it into the game the more stars you have to use to complete tasks, the amount of stars to complete tasks shouldnt go up it should stay the same. One star for easy tasks two stars for medium tasks three stars for hard tasks and timed tasks thats it! Fun game though and good time killer other then that.",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "It is very entertaining. I like it way better than homescapes although I like that game, too. I just find gardenscapes way more fun and less boring. A lot of different activities to enjoy, too! The latest update on skipping the effects at the end of each level is nice especially when you're on the last couple of minutes of your unlimited life. Good job Playrix Games!"

My complaints are: the sound design is awful, it's very low quality; the music doesn't go for very long before it loops; the saw level doesn't have any good skins. Otherwise it's quite addictive, plays best with the sound off and the Wi-Fi so you don't get the ads (which aren't too frequent, but they're there).",

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",

I saw an ad for this on instagram and decided to download it, and let me tell you I was not disappointed with the outcome. I've been seraching for games like this and I have finally come across such a fantastic game! The Fluffy charectors should be sold as toys because of their adorable look!",
        "It's casual, relaxing and fun. Super cute. And it has 2 huge pluses: first of all it feels rewarding since you actually have a realistic possibility of getting new fluffies; second, you don't have ads shoved in your face every 5 seconds, in fact you pretty much never see them.  Really great at the moment, hope it stays this way. Lots of respect to the Devs for staying away from annoying cash grab techniques.",
        "this game is adorable. the only thing i'm not quite sure about is the rainbow system; what does it do? how does it work? it would be great to have a page that explains the details to those of us who aren't great at working this stuff out. i'd also like to ask why there aren't plushies for these things??? they're so cute! i'd by tons of they were real. anyway, great game, and the little fluffy cubes are the sweetest things and i just want to hug them all.",
        "I love the fact that you can unlock new characters in different catagorys the graphics are great and the idea is awesome. The only thing bad about it is the game play add some treasure bonus or something like that to keep the players from not getting bored a bit. Also it glitches a little bit sometime and it prevented me from getting my high score. Anyways I love the game very addictive to try and get every fluffy and rainbow fluffy Love it but how is it a rainbow fluffy? Anyways LOVE the game very addictive",
        "ADORABLE! THE FLUFF'S FACES ARE JUST SO CUTE! But that isn't why you're reading this. Over all a good, simple game. Getting new fluffs is similar to crossy road, but it's kinda like a Minecraft dropper map. My only complaint is that the fluff is so big it's hard to see what's coming up, but that does add to the challenge.",
        "I love Fluffy Fall so much!! It is SUPER kawaii, fun, fuzzy, and enjoyable. It takes up your time as you try to beat your highscore!! Mine is 45.  I am really hoping that it updates, because I want all the monthly gem stones to be in stone section. I think it would be cool to have my gem stone. And play as it.  Anyways, I really love the game, it is so amazing!! If you love kawaii and fun games, get Fluffy Fall!!! 😊💕"

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

Let's see some more complex production trees, maybe completing an order requires a few different jobs to make various parts first. Lots of room to grow, and I hope to see improvements",

I'm at the point now where all I can do is open the game, collect money, restart the jobs, and close the game. What used to take 1 minute now takes over 10 minutes. I'm not going to stare at the screen and do nothing for 10 minutes.",

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",

I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "Simply Amazing Graphics. Gives real chess game feel. Great work developers!!! Pls make rules column in settings for beginners. I wonder why people call this a bad game if they can't complete levels. You need to try harder.. I Reached middle level in 6 games, It was a good game..",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board.

I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",

Opponent \"magically\" catches a monster fish with 2 seconds left in every 1 on 1 match and wins. Lost 13 straight matches like this. Have also caught a fish (out of water) before time expires and am not credited with the catch. A complete scam and money pit.",

        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "I downloaded it and played it. It worked for like 5 seconds. Can someone fix this or is it just me? Anyway if its just cuz its new to my phone then OK but if it doesn't work.. BOI Y DOES THIS GAME NOT WORK.. yet. Hopefully it works later. Um thats it. This is long. And that's it.♥",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂"

        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "Fun game. But it's a crapshoot if you can watch adds to use those two spells. I don't mind watching adds to use the spells, but over half the time you just simply can't watch any adds. Some times you can watch 6 in a row if you want, other games you can't watch a single one. Fix that!!",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",

Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",

Also it would be good if you added a edit program that allows you to get rid of everything on your farm except of the house and other things like that and then you can put it how you want it so basically decoration or designing your farm."

        "This game is great except, the fact that everytime I play now it won't allow me to finish even one match. It freezes the controls and eventually my phone after player 2 is done with their turn and I begin mine. Fix this big and I will gladly give 5 stars. This game deserves it.",
        "A lot of ads, but still a lot of fun. Had to lower my score since I cannot get the last character without paying. Fake \"video could not be viewed at this time\" message. Tested with other device that's still missing a bunch of characters. Still fun, but it is not free to play when something is locked that way",
        "After completing a second playthrough of the legendary tournament, clicked back on the ad that played after the last victory which caused game to restart cancelling the 15 wins I just completed. Very frustrating expecally when the hundred of ads forced upon you crash the game.",
        "Cool looking game played like 15 matches. Annndd then it started freezing. In a single player match i would fire 2 shots and the my entire phone would stop and the only way to get out is to close the app. Im using a galaxy j7",
        "Addicting and a good time killer, but there are a lot of ads, and every time I downloaded it, it gave my phone a virus. If you have a new and protected phone, get the game, but if you have an old phone, do not get this game. IT WILL GIVE YOUR PHONE A VIRUS AND YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING ON IT!!!!!!!!",
        "It's a very fun game when it doesn't lock up. It continually locks up even if you uninstall it and reinstall it. When you reinstall it you lose all your extra people points excetera. Very frustrating. Brand new Droid Z Moto phone. So the issues are in the game."

        "Still needed more testing It felt like a rushed product. Had very few features it was advertised to have. Last update took away more than it gave. If anything it feels like they've put less pokemon spawns out there than when it launched. If this trend continues it was just a very short-lived success only due to the name of the product used... has potential to be better but is being squandered on \"fixing\" things nobody is too concerned with like changing clothes or text errors.",

Apple manages to do that. Google offers a chance to do the same and it is ignored. So now I'm ignoring you. Bye. Previous feedback: No support for Android Oreo 8.0/8.1 (Adaptive Icons). And please don't just shrink the icon and use a white background. Looks ugly. It has 2 layers: icon and background. Quick and easy to implement! Thanks :)",

        "Hi EA! This is just an opinion from me n the whole members of The Sims Freeplay Malaysia. We're currently growing with rage number of members. We can't deny this game is super amazing and we always keep on postings about new updates and so on. This new update, we are so glad that finally EA comes with an idea about backyard! We can do almost everything about decorating our backyards. But, there's one thing that most of us still waiting from you. We want to build our creativity with different sizes of rooms. As for now, the rooms are in square shape. We would like you to know, if you could consider our suggestion for this. Thanks and have a nice day!",
        "The game is sooo good! Hi there EA! I love your game in a lot of ways. Your new update is superb and I can't wait for more. It's just... the game takes up too much space. I'm left with only 0.5 GB. And also, the in app purchases. If you could please just give something like free LP and SP along with simoleons as a daily reward even for the non VIP members, we would really appreciate it. Thank you.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "This is very much addictive, the only downside is that it utilises a lot of memory and my phone is only 16GB 😅... besides that, this is amazing. I do wish there was a way to make some quests that people may have missed because of downloading after the time the quest was available.",
        "I recommend anybody who is reading this review should play the game. The game is way more better than the original Sims. Plus it's free. And it's a lot more realistic. Only thing is it does need Wi-Fi and it takes up a lot of phone space but it doesn't drain out my data too quick. Seriously I rated 5 stars for the quality and the quests.",
        "Hello! A game is a class but there are very much minuses correct please! Why than more level the more expensive building houses, ? And yet actions very long to execute!!!!!! And children after сж to bear, to mark them OTHER 5 сж. Not well the same is long, and yet families it is difficult to create a bit. you will correct please minuses"

        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "The game is great, very time consuming and like the dance options to choose from when making your routine.  The only thing that I hated was the changing of the clothes. The clothes u had on from previous outfits stayed on you. For example....doing a ballet class outfit change, it kept the pants I had on from the hip hop class when I was trying to choose tights. Then I go to the hip hop closet and try to take the pants off but they wouldn't come. I had to uninstall the game bc it got very frustrating and made me not want to play it. Fix that issue and I will reinstall the game.",
        "It's really Fantastic BUT I didn't give 5 stars because 1.spa part is damaged it makes the game freeze 2.I don't like the mascaras they're not natural 3. Why the character is very pathetic,insecure and not confident. She must be a more confident girl when interacting with others. Please consider these problems.. I'm looking forward to playing the next sequel. Thanks a lot",
        "I get through one scene and the app closes itself. Really irritating because I get into the game after three adds finish the scene and wait for the loading screen but the app closes. If it is fixed I would love this game .",
        "Something that keeps happening to me. I dance off with another player. And i always win. Then it does firwworks and nothing else! What is wrong with it?!",
        "I really enjoyed this game however have to keep doing the same thing over and over just because I have to pay £6 for the doctor. A big let down and kinda boring now"

        "great game, so much fun and very addictive and a great time killer. can make friends from all over the world. i get great gifts for playing everyday. if you like this type of game you need to download this one, even if you have never tried a game like this please just give it a try. i had never played any kind of game like this and now i play 3 different ones everyday, so take it from me give it a try cause you never know you may become a daily player like me. THANK YOU GoG  for this GREAT GAME.",
        "It's great game more addictive than any other game I've played I've even caught myself  ignoring my console games just to play this more. You don't need more than 5 bucks to be a GOAT you just need to understand how to build you kingdom how you like. For instance,  I like to have more troops then building up my kingdom so I go for my troops, troop research, my wall defense and my troop resource gathering and resource load capacity. I've never played this type of game but it was easy to catch on. Please consider playing this game and come battle me.",
        "A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "Really just downloaded it to leave this. Saw an ad for this that clearly wasn't this game. The RTS they show is Cossacks: European War (or at least one of its sequels). It's a great older game on PC. This on the other hand is a pay to play monstrosity. So save yourself the hassle. Also seeing if I get the generic \"people don't have to pay etc.\" response from dev or if they have a defense for the false advertising.",
        "See the ad every time theres an ad playing so I said hey why not. The game doesnt even start. Lol what a joke. Maybe some marketing dollars should be saved and used for development. I am convinced your company has no financial, software OR marketing epertise. Lmao get ur old jobs if u can.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone..."

I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days.

I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",

You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "This game is definitely extremely addicting! I find myself playing this game more than any other. I'd give this game 4 stars simply because there are way too many locked boxes that I have on my land that I can't open. I think there should be an easier way to get purple gems or have a way to get them on every level we beat. Atleast 5 gems each time. I have over 50 locked boxes",
        "This game is wonderfully enjoyable but im very upset as I made an in-game purchase of gems and items and although Google confirmed my purchase when my game crashed it wiped my gems and any related items I had. The \"contact us\" button was very unhelpful and only had what looks more like a generic FAQ rather than a way to actually contact about problems like this. I would be happy to change my review if you could work on a better way to contact and also figure out why my purchase was wiped to prevent it in the future.",
        "I actually really like it. But since the new update yesterday there is no chance to get \"rid\" of the chests without paying. This is annoying. I have not the space respectively the storage to keep them",
        "save to facebook is broken. twice I have saved to facebook, then uninstalled and re-installed the game to fix crashing issues. the first time, I lost a day's play. so the second time I was very careful, checked to make sure it had saved \"just now\". that time, I lost 2 days of play.  a save game feature that loses days of achievements is garbage."

Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",

        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:"

It's graphics are amazing with control but the life us the problem but its OK in a game it happened but its recovering time should be more faster and videos should be available.  :-) .After one month I knew the way how to get so many cash without any payment if anyone want to know reply my comment.",
        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games."

        "This is a jewel in the Talking Tom series.  I am an adult, and I am thoroughly hooked!  I have to be on every day to do the daily challenge, no matter my schedule.  The snowboard side world is amazing.  I have never been able to ride a skateboard, much less a snowboard, but I admire the snowboarders and skateboarders who can.  With this world, I can, and it feels real!  My only caveat is that after Ben's world, there are no more new houses to conquer and work on.  So I earn gold bars and diamonds for nothing.   We advanced players need more houses!  Make Tom a vacation home or hunting cabin, I don't know!   Anyway, love the graphics, even the side ones as I run by don't go unnoticed.",

There is a lot of new in Temple Run updated version.... Do something at least on next update😊No new houses after ben only coming soon       Snowboarding, new looks in Tom, Angela & ginger houses, 🏘️ wah! Awesome!!!! 💐       Takes forever to load        Hope so u take these into consideration.... Once again Hats off to you Outfit 7!!!! 💐",

        "I feel as if my smartphone has been hacked into because i keep getting pop up notifications to install Talking Tom games..it is not making any sense to me! I suspect my OS is infected by a Ransomware or a Trojan or something of that sort because my Samsung Note 2 hangs a lot..a lot of apps are getting installed by itself as if someone had taken control of my phone..i feel my Xiaomi miA1 was way better than this even though they share the same OS! This is ridiculous i want my money back!"

        "10%... 3 hours later. Still 20% Now every single thing is a money making scam. I used to enjoy this but my liking has gradually decreased... The 6 islands used to be able to be explored leisurely... No. I Don't Want More. \"Hire A Worker\" \"You Dont Have Enough Food!!!\" NEED MORE SHOVELS!! Cannot Leave Islands. Have To Piss Away Cash Money On Gems To RETURN... MORE COIN PILES WOULD SURE BE NICE",
        "It's a nice game that gets you hooked really quickly. But as for the gameplay, all you can do is make your workers do tasks and then come back some hours later when they're finished. The expeditions are nice, most of all the graphics and the love to detail. Still it's impossible to fibish the expeditions in time unless you don't have no others hobbies. *smirk* But all in all it's fine! &lt;3",
        "It is amazing.really keeps you hooked on.. However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.",
        "I thought it would be more about solving things, but there are no brain challenges for now and I'm on the 10th level. I've noticed that a few times some of my coins disappeared. Slow as you need to grow a lot of food etc. before you can do anything. You would have to spend quite a lot of real money to make it reasonable pace",
        "Just wish coins would add up over time. You have to keep getting them as soon as they are available. Don't like having to it for an hour just to be able to do something in the game and then there is nothing to do but collect the coins every couple of minutes a few at a time. But this is a great ongoing game except for that.",
        "Such a great and fun game but you can't do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame."

        "So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.👍",
        "5 Stars simply because it fulfills its role as a casual puzzle game with ease. Game requires you to make a path for the ball as it adds more complicated maps and other map features as you advance through the game.",
        "Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.",
        "When the first time I saw the fame I thought that it would be a very boring game. When I saw it multiple times and red the rewies of other people I downloaded it finally. And it over come to be an amazing game."

        "I'm in the 60's level and find it very difficult to accumulate sufficient points to maintain play for longer than two or three games and that is after accumulating a days worth of \"harvest now\" points which requires your interaction every hour at this level and no play. You have to win at least a couple games without using the free points to purchase additional cards or wild cards, opening up as many cards as possible for as many options and longer streaks, and playing some of the \"cheaper (points wise)\" and easier glade challenges. Winning a games without additional cards barely gets you above where you started and any add'l cards drain you quickly even if you win to the point that you lose all and you have to accumulate another day of points for another 15 minutes of play.  Bonuses are just too slow in coming and wins just don't count for much. I love the peaceful backgrounds and graphics though.",
        "Love the game but I think the bonus levels to unlock gold crops should be heaps cheaper to play. Some of them are hard and you run out of money to keep trying them as they cost as much as a normal level to play.",
        "It looks good and the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately that fun only lasts so long before the game devolves into micro transaction hell. Each round gets so expensive that I can only play one or two unless I were to buy coin packs. These guys should be ashamed.",
        "I liked this  game, but each game cost to much to play and you go through credit to fast.  $500 a game, then it goes up pretty fast to $1000 a game, then to $1500 a game, etc... plus reply as wild cards cost a lot.  There are other solitaire   games that are less frustrating  I  would rather play.",
        "Once you get to the higher levels, it gets really expensive, and each game costs coins. Sometimes it takes up to 10 tries to pass a level. There should be another way to earn coins. Beautiful game, love to play, just too expensive, and any bought coins don't last long cause losing is so costly. Too bad because it's a fun game.  Could you please tell me what the incentive is to continue? Even when you make more money with more crops, it then costs more money to play.   I don't imagine you'll respond, but I hope so.",
        "Really fun game but costs too many credits to play and the extra five cards and wild are over priced considering the cost of credits per game round. Could be better if these issues get resolved I would edit my review to five stars all around."

It's also very childish and unoriginal, you don't get a serious feel when playing.. the ONLY plus is the graphics are good. But looks aren't everything",
        "I have to give this a 1 star for everything lol. This game has broken more copyright laws than any other mobile game I've ever played. The ads were completely false with other large title games gameplay. The game had the dignity to use a GTA V start up screen without crediting proper sources.",
        "Still early, things take longer to get done if you don't spend real time money, but it's entertaining, really dislike the prompts to like on facebook.  Nobody cares what my score is and I'm sure I'd lose friends if I filled their feed with gaming info.  Game is slow but fun.",

        "I just lost 49.99 on a recharge, and current event is glitching my score to 0! I sent screenshots thru line app @ mafiacitycs no one responded. This review will improve when my situation does. I've already spent Almost $200 and you guys are gonna lose my business. UPDATE: I've been in chat with customer service. I sent screenshots, and they say I've received gold. I currently have 2 gold so...Gonna say they're wrong I sent them screenshots and they are NOT fixing. I will change this comment when someone fix's my issue. This IS a great game. Doesn't mean I'm throwing away 49.99",

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",

The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",

        "I love playing talking angela so much, Its super fun and I love opening new packs of stickers! Also the graphics in the game are great. Although my only problem is that theres SO ads like a lot, also the outfits and make-up is SOOO expensive and its sometimes hard to earn coins and diamonds. But overall its a fun game and is a real time waster.",
        "This game is amazing! A real time waster and It's really fun! But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",
        "This game has too many adds in it. Every minute an adds pops up and it ends up being a video for another game, so I have to wait  and watch  it until it's  done. Please fix this if you can. Over all it's  a really good game.",
        "It's gd but when you watch a video I don't get the prize at the end and it's sooooo annoying. If got that fixed then would be 5 stars. That isn't put you off or anything it's a really good game I enjoy it a lot",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive."

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

Maybe put an option to come from a poor, average, or wealthy family, too? Also, everytime I age, it stops my memberships to art class, music class, and gym. It would be greatly appreciated if you could fix that. How about pets, as well? And friends.",
        "This isnt really even a game it is more like if you could control almost everyting you did in your life. It is extremley interesting and i wasted hours on this game when i was supposed to do some self assigned homework😂😂 my guy died in prison and he had 6 kids. He lived a good life. He had over 1 million dollars in cash and in net worth. RIP sean. You will be missed",
        "I am beyond addicted to this! It really is a lot of fun! But you have to have strategy to get things done right. I'd like more options to do things so hopefully there will be updates. All and all great time killer and I'm so happy it's on no wifi too! Great app",
        "Very run game.  Just wish you could save your progress when you have to exit out for a phone call, text messages, reboot the device or anything that requires you to exit.  That's the only reason I gave 4 🌟's. Once they add save life option I will change to 5 🌟's. Great game though. Would recommend everyone to try this game.",
        "Very nice. I think more careers should be added maybe a family tree option and being able to play on as one of your children? Maybe make transitioning easier it's kind of hard to and takes many lives to get it. Also maybe different traits could be unlocked like 'baby momma' or 'alcoholic'. Overall I love the game and it's very addictive nice game.",
        "Game is good love it but i give 4 stars for now but i hope it will have  (Suggestions) save game, sibling(s) (of my character), rich or poor family, details about mother and father, more details about partner and children and add more career like celebrity politician and more or something 😂and i hope that this suggestions can help make your game even better.  And if maybe some of this things happen i will give 5 stars😂"

        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "This game has some faults (microtransactions and pay to win) but overall is amazing. Doesn't need a powerful phone to play, can occupy you for hours, and can help you meet new people. I got this game a month ago and haven't stopped playing since. This is one of my favorite games of all time, over all devices and consoles. I highly encourage you to download this game if you enjoy minecraft-styled graphics and multiplayer fps. And surprisingly there is a truck load of customization: Clan Forts, Home Base, Skin Editor, Armor, Weapons, and Pets. Sandbox has lots of toxicity but is tolerable. Overall 10/10 and a must-get for try hards and casual gamers alike.",
        "once u reach high lvl gems are litteraly near impossible to get. Please add a way where you can buy gems with coins and vice versa also event keys with gems or coins, overall a good game but definitely a pay to win game which I really hate. Also more campaign would be nice as it is promised in the end of the 3rd world.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "Overall this is a great game but before i give it 5 stars you really need to fix a bug the matchmaking system. It keeps matching me up against a team who is almost 10 levels higher than my own, which means they get more health and have better weapons. This is making it really unfair."

        "My absolute favorite game on the market. Especially since I can use my own music. I love seeing the frequent updates. Keep it coming. Consider making dlc purchase packs, like 99 cents for a car, level, etc themed to certain things. I'd be very willing to support that.  Not a big fan of the levels other than Legacy. Legacy shows what this game can do with music and extreme visuals. The others are bland compared to Legacy.  Have been steadily unlocking all the cars, although I'm enjoying the Delorian.",
        "I really enjoy this game. Art style is good, vehicles are a nice blend of goofy and cool. However, I find that some courses (the first one especially) is too hilly. My car will climb a hill and just beyond my view a note will be there without warning in a different lane, making me miss it. It might just be the music I listen to that causes this problem. Anyways, great job AbstractArt.",
        "I love how the Delorean is more expensive than the lambo (free to use starter car) lol thats how I feel about the two as well. Damn what a great game. yall could make alot of money if this was a pc or console game that worked with spotify...also Carpenter Brut- \"Hang'em All\" should be built into the game. Its the perfect theme sound track for it. &lt;3",
        "This app is amazing! I wanna see it improved though.. I've noticed it only works for mp3 files. I'd like to see a couple things. A remove ads button, maybe a way to play it from any music, such as Spotify and maybe Pandora or other services like YouTube? Cause I don't use mp3s but I'm using it for this game, and it works, but the amount of ads... Please make a remove ads button! I'll pay for it for sure!",
        "Love the game and would give it a 5 star but would there be any chance to remove the blur effect or have an option to toggle. It makes it very difficult to focus when you're playing a fast tempo song. Also a sound when you collect or maybe  a very slight vibrate would t go a miss. Keep up the good work.",
        "Congratulations to the dev for making a game similar to Audiosurf for mobile! It is a really good concept, but still needs some work. The camera is sometimes looking down at the road and it refuses to cooperate that way. The visuals are so powerful that you can't fully understand what's going on in front of you sometimes. I would suggest improving the speed of the vehicle, and the first map should have the road a bit smoother, because it simply gets you confused. EDIT: After being updated, the game is getting better and better, which I really respect. New vehicles, new maps and a better gameplay experience. Some bugs removed and added some rebalances to the game, so it is more enjoyable."

        "Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I'm watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.",
        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach."

        "I felt like this be could have so much potential! I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "I hate this because of the excessively long adds. Takes too long to get to be able to play it. And there are even longer ones in between games. Not fun. And no way to skip them.",
        "I had to delete this game because every time you buy an upgrade for the ball an ad pops up. There is no reason to be that money hungry. Dont download, you'll just get annoyed because it becomes unplayable really quickly"

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "I like it and it is a good game, except now I have no sound and the videos do not leave the screen so I can spin the wheel. The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations.",
        "Great graphics. But why we can choose other maps only at a certain time? Why don't you let us enjoy all the maps?  There are issues with perspective. Difficult to judge the road and objects ahead. So, sometimes difficult to determine course of action.",
        "Game is excellent. But though I completed all challenges daily quests. indicating all with green ticks. It is showing collect two more keys. How tricky and fraudulent",
        "Would have been a 5 on gameplay and overall, but as you move up the levels, the daily challenges are more difficult to achieve. For example, I have been trying to survive five tunnels in the lost jungle for four days now, but never get to run in the tunnels. I had a run today of over 20k meters and didn't run in the tunnels once during that run. Otherwise, great game, but the gameplay manipulates it so that daily goals are harder to achieve as you advance."

        "FIFA mobile peaked with FIFA 14 in almost every way. It had career mode, better controls, more realistic have gameplay and better ultimate team. It's a real shame you can't play it any more. Another thing they had always been lacking from FIFA mobile is the ability to properly customize how your team plays. This means the player who wins is the one who can best adapt to how EA had set the team up to play. This makes the game less rewarding as I do not like my teams to play in the way that EA ways them to. 😔😔",
        "The game in my opinion is very rewarding. For example you get an Elite Cristiano Ronaldo at the beginning but they could add multiple updates to make it better. I actually have a no like about this game which is that it drains your battery usage fast and that's not good. The overall of the game is OK but they can add updates to make it better.",
        "In the vs attak mode if i lose a game i lose 8000 fans and if i win it i get only 6000 fans. It is a great game but this is a problem. More over in some matches i donot get great chances to score while the opponent gets 10 great chances. It very unfair. Many times if the game hasn't started and my server crashes i loose the match and stamina. And i cannot play the game for a hole day because of server problem evenif my internet connection is quiet strong.  Execpt this everything is gr8.",
        "I request the developers to consider the following points... 1.The team can't be substituted while playing season games. 2.The game shows unknown errors sometimes while playing and crashes. 3.It would be good if getting the elite players become easier.. Rest it's surely one of the best game of EA and undoubtedly for the football lovers..Keep updating... I would like it more if you improve the physics of the game like curving the ball etc....please make it....",
        "Vs mod is so bad after update. I have ovr 99. After update i lost many games from some guys who have ovr 94-95 because u didn't give me as many great chances as u predict. Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok.",
        "The only I wanted to tell is that the game shows that the master players are very rare and we have a chance of getting them but trust I have been playing fifa for a lot of time and I never got like a player in like chance or in free packs I do not even get silver players. So I suggest that you increase the chances of getting these kind of players."

        "I just downloaded this game today and so far I give it 5 stars. *The tons of ads are a bit much & I can honestly do without them* but I love the numerous levels and the fact that this game helps keep the wheels of my young mind turning. I'm quite interested in finding out what else is in store in this game.",
        "It's very nice game a puzzle type very interesting to solve all those. But I've a problem in Luminous part I'd achieved only 300 stars out of 500 because there are no further levels to be played. The game is displaying that levels are coming soon, but my questions is when? So pls solve this problem. And pls rply for my review so that I'll understood that u had read my message. Thank u and sry if had hurt u in above msg✌️✌️✌️",
        "Don't want to play hours of boring levels to get to (hopefully) more difficult stuff. I would have no issue if the levels were at least different from each other. It takes merely 10 seconds to get through the starting levels but there are just too many. It's wasteful.",
        "Far too easy once you figure out the conceit of the game.  No way to skip ahead to harder puzzles without paying, unskippable 30 second ads. Maybe there's a challenge later in the game, but I'm not going to solve 300 easy boring puzzles or pay money to find out.",
        "Good for burning time. Fun puzzler. The ads are atrocious; I understand wanting to get something out of your creation, but I'm burning through levels so quickly it seems like ads are every few seconds. The game isn't exciting enough for me to buy ad-free. They're pop up ads, which are the worst kind for accidental clicking.",
        "The game is nice, follows its simple rules well. Only issue I find is the slow rise in difficulty, it being that it's easy to pick up but hard to find that point where its difficult. Otherwise, its a good way to pass the time. Also I do like some of the soundtrack."

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!",
        "Great app! Loads quickly, gameplay is smooth and intuitive. I also haven't found the different levels of difficulty to be repetitive, which is a good thing. I have found with other Sudoku apps, a pattern emerges from each of difficulty so that I almost know what the puzzle will look like by picking how hard it will be.  This one isn't like that thankfully!"

Once i got a 15 second ad, but the skip time stayed constant and i had to watch the entire thing. The game also bugs you constantly about connecting your facebook account. So if you want to be able to play without interruptions constantly, you need to pay and connect to a facebook account.",
        "Brilliant, innovative, addictive game BUT please reduce the number of ads. That's why this game is only averaging  3.5* and why I can only give it 4*. People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Too many ads with a skip button that reduces ad time by 10 seconds. Literally, f off, dude. Can't play your game, I play for a minute and than watch an ad for half of that time. Unfair and boring. You almost don't get to play the game. Which is, btw, awesome",
        "Visually satisfying, nice, fitting soundtrack and pretty innovative. One thing is that it's extremely packed with ads. One every round you play. Maybe dial it down a little?  Also, maybe add tail patterns...",
        "Unshippable, mandatory ads after every failure, this enough gives it the rating it deserves. There are way better ways it implement ads that dont shove it in your face. Otherwise, I would recomend as a time killer"

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "Fantastic game.I am loving this game. Still there is few problem.Miniclips please solve the issues. After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "Edit: Got worse because it costs me money & gold and the broken controls are causing losses. Uninstalling.  Defense. It's broken. I just tracked the touches through the debugger and 2 out of 5 times I swipe right up, but the goalie jumps down. Fix that or many people will switch to other games.. I know I will."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ☺",
        "Awesome game, one of my favourites. Only suggestion would be that the bonus hours of unlimited lives could be gameplay hours, not actual time hours as it is sometimes impossible to continue playing depending on when you are awarded the bonus but on the plus side there are many opportunities to get bonus hours or recharges, much more than many other games.",
        "Fun & super adorable match 3 game - the only game I've kept playing for years (3-4?!) Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute!

What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",

Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.",
        "This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!"

        "Only been playing for a short time but so far it seems very enjoyable. At the moment I can play for free and seem to be progressing. I have noticed a few ridiculously hard levels. I'm not going to pay to win so I had to spend a while building health potions which gets repetitive. Apart from that it's fun over all.",
        "This game is just about money with no reward. Gets boring after a month and even through my power is over 3100 i can't beat 2800 power quests....Ummhmm....seems I do the exact damage I did when I started...mechanics are messed up..and no purpose",
        "Very good game and a great time killer. It can take some time to get your team up to strength to fight certain levels. They have spoiled the game slightly with the all new alliance wars  that some people didn't want. It's impossible to find items to ascend your hero's to the next level to make them stronger. Also to level up troops it costs a lot of in game food to level them up. You need a lot of patience to play this game. If not then don't download. I wish I hadn't now.",
        "I've been playing this game for sorry one year now and I do like it but it has a few flaws.  It takes a very long time to level up heroes, it's very hard to get good heroes because it's just by chance, and you don't get very many gems at a time if you want to get anywhere in this game you have to spend money.  Now they have a VIP 4.99 for a month you get 30 gems a day, and extra regular summon, and instead of just be able to upgrade one building at a time you can do two at a time.  It really is helping me get all my buildings to the same level. There is also alliance wars now and they also have challenges.  With a few tweaks I would give this game 5 stars hands down.  I definitely recommend it.",
        "Great if you buy your way through the game. The fun lasts a few hours and then it's an endless grind of frustration. You won't get any better characters unless you purchase them with microtransactions and will lose....... A LOT.  Greed wins and the sheep that can throw their money at a mobile game will triumph.",
        "Feels like there's too much going on at once with the base and everything, and it eats up an ungodly amount of battery... But it's a cool game! Match 3 with strategy RPG assets. The strongest point is definitely the art."

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

        "This game is not bad.. Loved it.. This game is much better than the online games.. You know, the games which are like this but not great as this.. It really makes time fly... But, there are surely some negative points...",
        "Hello Devs, I just wanted to say something really quick. I have been a hardcore player of this game(and HSW) almost since this game came out. I really love this game(in fact i've replayed this game about 3 times[I've \"accidentally\" deleted this game a couple of times and forgot to use the cloud save]) ,but I have been playing this game on an ipad for the last couple of years. I've recently received a chroomebook and have downloaded this game, but there is a problem... THE BOOSTING DOESN'T WORK!!! Apparently the boosting works on the pc version by pressing the right mouse button. So all i'm asking is to fix the chromebook's boosting(cause I really master this game a fourth time and get that new Leo shark thingy). Boosting is a huge part of HSE(like catching prey or using a special shark's power) so can you guys please fix the chromebook's boosting problem and thanks for listening. Sorry for yelling earlier... ;)                                                                                                                                                                                     Edit: Please respond to this so I know that this will be patched in the next update. Thank you.",

The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",

I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.",

        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!",
        "Other than a gas glitch, I play this all the time. Takes some time to get the right parts for your cars. So if you can just race and collect money until you get a car with all 6 red parts, it's quick entertainment. You have to buy \"super nitrous\" to beat the leader in a race for his car...which sucks. There should be someway to get super nitrous in the game without buying with real money.",
        "Awesome game and graphics, but pretty much have to spend money if you wanna compete. Should have more races available a t all times. Need to make ALL cars accessible to purchase, with preferably money earned in the game and not $20 of real money or depend on luck to get a good car in \"rare imports\". Especially, when available races are so limited, supply races, etc., unless you're satisfied with just regulation races.",
        "The game is good, but the \"race a boss for their car\" is definitely a con. You beat them with ease, then re-race for their car and suddenly they can run like 3 seconds quicker? Do me a favour...  It would be better if after each race you went back to the map rather than the garage. Going back to the garage is seriously annoying.  It would be good if we could have some sort of crew v crew event. Say, 10 racers from each crew pick a car and set a time. Then you get matched up with an opponent and you have to beat their times. Then it's most overall wins or something for crew points?"

        "Loved this game. Very addictive. But just like other recent reviews, since March 2018 problems with no help at all from company. Have not received about 4 gift boxes or rewards for at least 4 levels even tho i completed them. Doesnt advance either. I have to search what level i stopped at. On one of my devices says no internet connection and sent me back. Have stopped playing on that device. Contacted company twice to no avail. Will search for a new game with totally different company",
        "Do not waste your money on the game. I use to enjoy it and had no problem paying for things. I believe a company should make money if they do their job. Since it was sold to a new owner they no longer answer anyone's questions. They send you to a link that has everyone else scrambling for answers. They also do not replace items you lose when the game has problems. They do not care if you purchased them. The old company use to replace items and gold bars when it was the games glitches. They actually cared about the people playing it. The owners now can not even be bothered to reply. If you play it only get the free stuff. Do not waste your hard earned money on this game. They will not spend any time to make sure you get what you paid for",
        "Why did bubblegum hill disappear in the middle of the day today? Also the power ups are not staying the allotted amount of time either? I've spent money on this app but won't spend anymore!",
        "Wont open load or do anything even with newest update please fix! Every time there is an update it messes up and won't load the levels I'm on. Frustrated because I love the game itself. Getting so mad it won't load every single time it updates! I was trying to get to 1500 before my birthday fat chance in hell now.",
        "I really like the game but i made it to level 895 or897 somewhere around there. I go to play the game and it has me back at level 705. It keeps telling me to go online to download other levels. When i go online i see a lot of people having the same problem but I can't seem to get to the problem. I really enjoyed the game but it's not any reason to continue to play if i can't go any further."

        "This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Great game. It is easy to use but still challenging. The controls are smooth and consistent and there are plenty of things you can purchase but don't have to to enjoy the game. Only reasons for losing a star is no way to play alone or practice, it has to be against someone. Also, there is not a way as far as I can find, to turn off notifications. Lastly, it does use battery pretty fast. Is is not a \"battery killer\", but does drain it faster than other games. However it probably does take a bit of power for all this game does.",
        "Excellent game against real people who reply to you if you click one of the comments (for those who say it's a computer we play against). My only problem with it is there should be an option to buy gems with coins rather than have to always pay real cash for gems. If it had this option I'd give 5 stars!",
        "Was fun at first, then massive losing streak due to other players making every single shot perfect.  But most of the time when I start spending money I do better.  Odd.  I think I found a cheater during a putt.  He lined up correctly, however with the power he should have missed the hole.  I tried to watch the replay, but it is the only replay unavailable.  Then when we do the tie breaker shootout, he hits with pinpoint accuracy on the edge of the rough/fairway to get within 2 ft of the hole.",
        "Good gameplay, but the matchmaking is not the best. Have been playing for a week, and I'm rarely matched with someone that is at my level. Opponent almost always seems to be higher with much more leveled clubs.  Update: Have kept track of the last 100 games. I had more experience and better overall clubs in 17 of them... Please match against experience, NOT trophies.",
        "After playing for a while it just isn't that great.  It shows too much of what other people are doing and then makes you go first.  Which is the opposite of competitive. I've now tried for a few months but honestly it's designed to make you spend cash.  I still play a little but constantly think about uninstalling it.  It gives you a free golden tee shot maybe once a week.  The rewards are meh... Because you know if you won too much you wouldn't need to spend real cash.  For the amount of rewards you get it should play the free golden tee shot 3 times a week.  The best feature is that you can save a shot and upload to YouTube easily."

        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying."

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character",

        "I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe",
        "It's a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.",
        "I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it's like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn't die like the heck",
        "The game is cool but there's a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won't let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit"

        "I get that ads should be used to support a free app.. But this game is unplayable due to every ad they insert. Literally after every action is another 30 sec ad. You can't even play the main game because they kill you with ads. Uninstalling.",
        "So many ads they interfere with gameplay! What should be a quick turn becomes a 3 minute play. I don't ads, I support developers making money and even click on ads for bonuses, but this is ridiculous. The game is also laggy, which I suspect if from the ads trying to load. Expect game crashes as well - one occurs every gameplay for me.",

        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "This is overall the best golf game I have come across or any app, in general, relating to sports. My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account. I wish there would be a way to play with your family; without the facebook account users perks.",
        "Main screen isn't immediately obvious what does what. Also a bit annoying that my level changed and I didn't see the wager increased so i was quickly running out of coins until I realised I could step down again. Good game so far though.",
        "I used to think it was a Pretty decent game. But it keeps stealing money. I had $21,000, and went to play a game for $20,000, and it lost connection for a dang second and zap went my coins!  This is the first time its happened with the large coins, but its happened several times with the $1,600",
        "Needs more obstacles on lower levels. Noticed good players staying in lower levels because there isn't any competition. Clubs are better than a beginner wich makes sense but higher levels should only be limited to a certain amount at a lower level. Over all I love it though"

        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",
        "Mind Blowing Game..But Could You Guys Please Include \"Voice Chat\" It will Make the game more Awesome.. Its so tough To Contact With Team Mates. In chat box By typing..Please..see in thus matter.. #Devlorpes",
        "I had to update my review to reflect the state of the game since the new update. Game is unplayable. After I land, unable to p/up anything, then I'm unable to move. Keeps trying to reconnect me to unfinished match. Huh? Please fix",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die",
        "👉Its awesome game ....I want a game like PUBG on phone and I got this ...its epic game BUT hacker sucks add security system like clash of clans no one can hack coc soo just a epic game ......thanks for creating this game Elex company....... 😘😘😎VERY VERY AWESOME"

The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you're in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I've been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you're new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station's.",
        "Movga not answer requests, game very expensive if you want to play and on the top of this you could not trust developers  because you are charged for items you did not get,graphic effects your eyes  and if you're longer playing you could asleep. All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.",
        "The game seems to go through faze's some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.",
        "The translator needs fixing,  it's ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don't like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly.",
        "As always the same issues constantly highlighted by many users bugs, game kickouts, freezing. These issues have been brought to attention by many but the usual response by speak to movga directly look at all the other bad feedback given they Don't want to put off potential new people. Is Waste money try a different game nothing ever gets sorted and if they do it doesn't last long and same issues arise.",
        "Game would be better if was based on skills rather than how much money you can spend on it. They should remove prosperity as it is abused before legion battles or regional battles. The players with the deepest pockets win no skills required... I love the game but the model is wrong."

        "In all honesty I LOVE Jetpack Joyride! The things I DON'T love are these: I don't love all the ads...it never use to have all these ads. I don't love that it freezes up on my phone 9/10 forcing me to force stop it to play it. I don't love the fact that despite having it on other android devices and having synced it after getting a new phone I STILL had to start from scratch.",
        "I like this game for the most part. It has a few issues though. Half of the time when I watch a video for a reward it will play the whole video but then tell me \"An error occurred. Please try again later.\" When that happens it doesn't give me the reward and it won't let me try again. But the thing that really bothers me is that it WILL NOT STOP sending me notifications. I've turned off notifications at least 20 times, but when I go back in 10 minutes later it's turned them on again without my permission. I've blocked notifications from the game in my phone settings and that stops it from displaying the notification but it still plays the alert sound every night. It's really starting to irritate me and if it isn't fixed soon I'm going to uninstall this and lower my rating.",
        "I love the game overall, but the only downside I have for it, is how we're not getting discounts on jepacks and clothing anymore. I'm unsure if it's only an android thing, but I really miss that feature. That for me was the reason I grinded this game so much during the time, because I was able to buy them with 50% off, not just buy currency and get it straight away. It would be nice to see some more jepacks too, as well as other content.",
        "Most addictive game I've played in years. Only gripe is when holding screen to speed up end of level timer it restarts 2-3 times.",
        "The game is amazing. I've been playing this since it came out about 7 years ago. The thing is it brings back nostalgia for me and that plays a big part in the core gameplay for me. Thank you guys, you are amazing! One little issue though, sometimes the ads I watch for doubling the points or for the free revive don't work. It just says \"an error occured\" and it won't do anything. Could you please try to fix this. It's a shame after a good run not to be able the double my points or whenever I would need to revive, it just wouldn't work..."

I havent spent any money, but to make it way better it would be nice to. Gives u more options along the story. I'm not to find of waiting 4 hours each time just for 2 tickets to continue, but maybe that's how u get hooked lol",
        "it's an amazing and addictive game... awesome graphics but stories are short.. u have to wait 3 hours for just 2 tickets also there r no free diamonds so we can't make a better choice.  I suggest free diamond after every level and 20 diamonds after a season.. it would be better. fix this then u deserve 5 stars definitely. this is most common  problem.",
        "I don't know if I will continue to play I am at home taking care of my Mom and trying to play with out having to pay for tickets and diamonds so I don't have time to waste.  I am waiting for the game to change that.  Not all of us have the money to buy extras.  I am one of the people who can't really afford these games.  I have stopped playing a lot of the games because of that.  It's frustrating.",
        "I'm stuck at level 11 ea time I make a choice it says reloadn n it goes back to the start its frustrating cause its been over 24 hrs and I can't even contact d technical department. I do not wna get billed for a technical error",
        "I like it . In my opinion it's alot better and more realistic  than episode.  It's addicting the stories are crazy it's like criminal minds in a book kinfirst da. Only thing I hate is it only give u 2 passes when you start.  And it take over 3 hrs to reload . And if you don't have diamonds you have to choice a different answer it only gives you free diamonds when you first start after that you have to buy it yourself.",
        "The graphics are amazing and story line keeps u on ya toes!! Drama, romance and thrilling action everything is jam packed...only wish you could earn diamonds as well but guess everything can't be perfect"

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I'm very upset with this game. I've been playing it for more than two months. I've put a lot of time and effort into this game and I made sure to play it every day for the rewards. Unfortunately, the game started glitching so I uninstalled it  and reinstalled it and all my work is gone. All my money is gone. It's very unfornate. I refuse to start from level one when I was one level 22. I loved this game. Not anymore. 😤",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Let your app data be backed up... My old phone has to be replaced and after a lot of work everything was still not saved. I feel this is a pretty simple thing to have included and a dumb thing to leave out. Fail. Thanks for taking my money and running.",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath..."

Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Absolutely love this game! Been playing forever, this game never gets boring. It's completely free, you just have to be patient and cautious with your materials. Amazing for a free to play app 😍😍",
        "⚠ WARNING: ⚠ This game is designed to force you to gamble your money! If you want to have any chance in progressing in this game, then be prepared to spend thousands of dollars! All OP heroes are \"Gem Only\" and can only be acquired by \"rolling\" for them. Some heroes like Minotaur and Destroyer can ONLY be acquired after buying a certain amount of gems amounting to $1500+ USD. The people who says that they can get *ALL* heroes without spending anything are either dumb as a rock or paid trolls by IGG... This Game is *ALL* about money and nothing else... Most of the \"In-Game Events\" is about getting a chance to get an OP hero after buying a certain amount of gems. The rolling system is rIGGed to force you to keep rolling and buying Gems! Did I mention that the price of changing your In Game Name will cost you 15,000 Gems or $99.99 USD? If you want to gamble your money, you will have a BETTER chance in a Real Casino than this Pay-To-Win game! You've been warned!!! Thank me later...👎👎👎",

        "This game is great if liked it ever since I started I've been playing for about 6 years I've had three other account before I putt a bit of money in them I lost them it made me angry but I just started again at first when I started you did have to put a bit of money in to it but now you don't really have to you can just spend like $20 here and there that's not much and its great now you get those gem packs just save until you have 999 of them and save your gems you get don't spend any until you get 999 and you should have enough for some good hero rolls"

        "This game is actually really fun, but two stars for the ads. They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Great game! Simplistic in the greatest form from graphics to game play. Would be 5 stars but -1 for placement of bottom ad I mean so easy to accidentally hit. Well placed I'm sure....With recent update I think you get random ad runs too. Game 5+ stars. 4 because of ads..",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Too redundant. After a couple times it's boring and way too many Ads. I only played 5 rounds and there were Ads after every round. That's 5 Ads for every minute of gameplay (give or take). Developers are making a killing. Little too greedy if you ask me and all of you are falling for it.📵",
        "Waaay too many ads, especially in the beginning when you're still getting the hang of the gameplay. Having to watch a 15 second ad after every crash – given how often that happens – is unnecessary. Granting 3 lives between ads would do a lot to keep players who would otherwise say \"I don't have time for this\" and drop the app like I did.  I would even be willing to pay to get rid of ads once I know that I like the gameplay, but the current system interrupts play so much that I couldn't even get to that point."

        "Well I think you need better graphics and I don't like how it is slow when you turn. Plus it has TOO MANY ADS! I just started playing this game! The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?",
        "The game is good but too many adds they need to add animals and you should be able to interact with the chests and furnaces .  The game needs to be more like minecraft then it would be better.  I suggest you don't install it 😠.  It's so boring DON'T install it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "Ok let's get things straight this game is a copy and is a cheap version  of mine Craft this game is lame I hate I I don't even recommend this game and whoever is the author of this game you suck never playing this game again",

So to me that much time for so many ads thrown at you and so little reward isn't worth the time.",

The game crashes alot, i am offen timed out when wanting to pick a player becuase i have to 'wait for the opponent' for some reason. Also time times the opponent is timed out and the game freezes on the timed out screen, which happends frequently. Also for salty players who just quit at soon as they dont get the captain they want and leave, there are no repercussions in which their should be so that they dont have a perfect record. I love the game and it passes time but the problems make me only rate the game a 3 star rather than a 4 or 5.",

I wouldn't even mind that you could for instance, apply a penalty for opening many packs at once like dice roll decrease on packs luck. But sometimes sitting at so many closed packs makes me wanna quit the game just for the sake of boredom, having to click 4 times to open, wait for the loading times and doing this over and over again. This ruins the gameplay a little for me. Regardless, easily one of the best games available in the play store. Extremely well done Dev team.",

        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?",
        "BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..",
        "Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn't have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you're reading this and you're questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! 😉😀☺",
        "Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don't track. At least my checkpoints save.",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!"

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone",
        "Ea is extremely greedy and will not fix the broken restore purchases button. I  contacted them about this issue and was offered in game currency for pvz2 and bejeweled and a generic sorry for troubles. Nothing about zzsunset that appears on the paid version of pvz or even if they own it or was scammed. Stay away from EA products"

        "The concept is great and was actually quite fun, but the ads were over the top. There is a permanent ad banner that covers up a part of the game screen which is just horrible design. Also I opened the game up again and all my saved data was gone. I had unlocked 3 \"world's\" and poof all gone. That was the reason I uninstalled.",
        "Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there's a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it's not bad enough to lose a star.",
        "Great game! Relaxing and fairly simple with occasional challenging levels, exactly what I like in a mobile game.   One annoying thing  I would like to flag up to the developers is that in the new erasor and draw modes there is no way to know what colour you are, so you either have to guess or go back to the menu, which is very irritating, couple of ideas to fix; keep the progress bar at the bottom there whilst you are doing your moves, as you always play as the top colour. Or just a simple dialogue box or even a dot in  the corner that pops up as you start the round to tell you. Would be a much needed qol change.  Still gave 5 stars as the game is great, but a fix to this would be a welcome addition.",
        "Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.",
        "Fun, relaxing, thought-provoking in a very simple graphic. The ads are bad as they interrupt the mild tones and flow of the mini-puzzles. Over all very nice but needs more to be anything more than a time-killer",
        "Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again"

        "Super easy to run out of storage, then when you try to sell nobody wants to buy anything even if you price it 75% off total price because they're full too. It would be nice to be able to delete items you can't sell, don't want, or can't use. Really want love the game.",
        "Really...24 hours and three guys for 1 tree! Building takes too long. Fun graphics. would reccomend as a filler game only. Game play and progression too slow to be one of your main games.",
        "It's quite annoying that you have to wait so long for all the buildings. Days. And fighting the trolls. Again, days. And that it is so hard to get the flame amulets that you need in order to make progress. It saps all the fun out of the game.",
        "I gave a name to my village but after logging in through fb i get only my fb name displayed. I wanted the initial farm name only to be displayed. At first the game was fun.. but now time taken is too much for each task to be complete which is frustating"

Too bad, no PLAYERS = poor ratings & no data for them to sell. More interested in videos than PLAYERS. Had been great game, no more. Only good...great graphics.",

I did like it at first till i caught on to this little act and was very discouraged. Come on Developers what the hell!!!!",
        "I love it its addictive but they need to add more ways to get gold like from completing levels, feind of fortune, missions, and crates. I hope you add this because I don't have a Google play card so I can't buy any gild and am stuck on 9 gold for spending it all in the beginning so please add this I hate not getting to buy costumes for feinds and not get to buy feinds.",
        "Great game to pass the time but you shouldn't have to lose all your streaks over one loss. Streak loss should go down gradually as it does when earning streaks. From 3 to 2 to 2 to 2 to 1 with each loss. Excellent graphics. Interesting and entertaining. Recommended to family and friends.",

I could play it all day. But it is snowing hard core right now soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......................................................

Game keeps crashing and restarting, I have a lot of times I don't get my whole free time awarded to me. I am seriously considering uninstalling this game because these issues are taking the fun out of it.",
        "Overall is addicting, but I'm so pissed off that the game keep on crashing at level 754. Whenever I was almost winning, the game will crash. I even rebooted my phone but it still happened! When I was losing that level, the game was totally fine. Thank god there's a 24hr free lives right now, but I will uninstall it if this problem is not rectified asap.",
        "This game makes it too apparent that they want you to spend money with them. Games are more fun when you get so caught up in them that spending money on them is just an afterthought. This game is designed to stop you from winning in to many different ways. The birds that are supposed to help you only screw up your strategy most of the time, and I have seen bubbles just reappear. Not joking, literally watched them just appear out of nowhere. I have seen too many ways in which a win can be taken away from you. So, it feels a little unfair and forced. I understand it is business, but it seems to be designed to be a little to greedy for my taste.",

        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go.",
        "This game is beautiful! I have always loved Tekken ever since the 1st and have played them all. I only wish some of my favorite characters weren't missing, like Lei and Bryan and I haven't seen Yoshimitsu or Heihachi Mishima. Overall I am very impressed. Thanks, I have been waiting for this on Android for a long time! I would rate 4.5 stars ☺"

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you've collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

        "This is actually a really good game. And while I would refer a flat fee to buy it without ads even the ads aren't that bad. Yes there are ads but the game is free and even the \"microtransactions\" are so minor and the currency so easily obtained in game I can easily overlook the ads. Some have called it a Mario clone but in a way aren't most platformers but unlike so many of them this is actually very creative and well done. Excellent job!!",
        "A great Mario Clone.... Very close gameplay to the original. I love playing the game and have got very far through the levels but even tho I was signed in with Google account I lost my game progress after having to reset my phone. Am I missing something? Is there a way to get my progress back?",
        "Really good game only reason I gave it 4* is because when the the toads or snails are close... they seem to be 1 - 2 steps away and you still either die or shrink into small Mario... other than that little glitch it seems really good.",
        "Great game, my children 7 & 4 love playing it.... when they get a chance haha😁 One thing I have noticed is you need to fix up the 111st to 111th after defeating the Boss! There is no st in 111",
        "Love this app . Actually I install this app in my previous mobile but my bad luck I lost it.and in My pre.mobile I  reach 125 level .i became so sad that I will not able to play my sboy adventure game and next day I just buy new phone. first app that I install in phone is this app🌟🌟🌟u deserves 1000000000000stars.",
        "I finished all 140 parts, the more higher the more challenging. It always made me curious about this. Wait for d next part 2,3,etc from SWorld Boy Adventures. Just need fixed for controls the pictures doesn't\u200b moved while we repeat at the same level that We failed. Overall for me it's good game's."

So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",

I see your response and no, I stand by my answer, if you guess and pick 2 you will be right way more than you are wrong. Answer 2 comes up way more than any other answer, sometime 3 times in a row. No other answer comes up that many times, I made a chart, I know I'm right, you're trying to believe your programming.",
        "It's very good, indeed! The questions are truly endless, which is veru  refreshing (literally), although some questions are a bit too scientific for me, but I can't blame the game for my lack of knowledge in this specific field. However, I can even it out because most of the scientific terms are basically in Greek, so I unerstand what most of them mean and answer a few science questions correctly. Apart from that, there is history, geography, grammar and spelling, politics, art, the pop culture in general. Being Greek, I feared that the majority of questions would have to do with USA stuff, like most of the other quizes, but it's not. This game asks questions about things that are taking or have taken place all around the world and sometimes the correct answer demands very specific knowledge. It's a great quiz!",
        "Seems the majority of questions relate to ancient times.  Not common knowledge.  A bit frustrating. Also, loss of points for wrong answers much greater than points gained for correct answers. Seems a bit unfair.  Fun game however.",
        "A rare gem in a sea of horrible game apps. Ads are rare and the questions challenging. A great way to exercise my brain or kill time at the DMV. I'm hooked!",
        "I stink at math & geography. OK in literature, Nature, art, some science, some biology, so I do OK there.But really, really wish would give all measurement systems instead of just metric!!",
        "Accuracy seems to be an issue.   I could be mistaken but, I doubt it."

        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "This would be a hands down game because of graphics and the variety of parts let alone I love the breakdown of the entire car. I just have tapping problems. Some parts won't let me remove them and when it comes to placing the putty, the screen sticks to camera mode and no matter how much I swipe it zooms in and out and pops up ads. Very annoying. I was getting into the game then found these flaws. ZTE Blade Z Max.",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "The gameplay is great, but the game crashes a lot. I run it on a Oneplus 3, with nothing else open, still it collapses fairly regularly. I can't imagine how bad it could be on some less powerful devices, but it's fixable, so I'm not pessimistic. Also, if you could add two-touch swipe to the Engine part, that'd be great, it's tiring to tap parts just to move the picture, or zoom out and try tapping something in the area where I'm headed. Thanks guys!",
        "Whenever I open it, it crashes immediately, probably due to the quality of the graphics. Please maybe downgrade the graphics as a default option, and have an option in the game to change it to a higher quality. I use the Samsung Galaxy S5, not the most powerful thing in the world but I'm sure you can fix it."

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",

        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!"

The home button on the pause screen is also a trap, especially if you accidentally touch it and lose a very high score. Annoyingly clickbait-y for ads, all in all.",

I don't know if it's my own problem or the game's problem, but I deleted the game once and got it back again thinking all my balls were still saved. Once I opened the game and checked,I found nothing. I exited the game and tried again, but still nothing. I really hope it's all a bug or something...",

        "It's OK I love to play the game when I'm bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I'm offline. But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren't available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you'll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I've made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you've to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",
        "THIS GAME IS THE WORST!!! Save yourself some time and DON'T install this thing I can barely move the car so please make easier to control. I know your trying but I,m sorry I,m uninstalling this game.",
        "I don't know why the controls have a 3.7 rating, they're actually pretty good. The gameplay's decent and the graphics are too. Btw I get over 600 score everytime just to let you know because the controls quote on quote \"barely move the car\""

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "THE BEST GAME IN THE APP STORE! The controls couldn't be any simpler, the graphics are sick, the gameplay is exciting, it's challenging but not impossible, it's crazy addictive, the soundtrack is awesome, and you don't have to spend real cash to advance if you don't want to. Even if you do, you can get a lot of different things for under $5! The developers should have statues built of themselves cuz this kick ass game could easily cost $6 or $7. You all did an amazing job and I can't wait to see what else you genius game creators come up with!!! The other Devs should be real nervous, cuz this game destroys all others. Bow down before the awesome glory that is Fastlane!!!",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to 'buy' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don't spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game."

        "Would have rated a 5, but I think the cost to continue a level ($300 and up) is disproportionate to the $$ awarded when you beat a level (&lt; $50).  Exceptional storyline and graphics!  Cute animals and decorations. Love that I have several choices on some items. I hope new animals and habitats are available soon!",
        "To all those who are complaining about tough levels and too many levels, I say this is a great design. For almost all levels, so far, I found there is a subtle trick that makes it easy to solve. Also since I completed all levels I really can't agree to the \"impossible part\". This is a great game design with sub plots. But please let us have the new levels soon.",

        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",
        "Too many adds and too many game load fails, loose upgrades all the time due to this. Of which there are too few to begin with. In my opinion this needs to run seamlessly too keep a player engaged as the graphics and game play are so incredibly basic.",
        "What did you do? Why ruin a game. Club gas bonus won't work. I've been racing the same three bots for days. Steals gas. Steals diamonds. Fix it! I'm close to uninstall we suspend real money you know?",
        "Was a great game but is all messed up now.  Freezing, dropping, can barely even get races to start.  Don't know what happened but it needs to be fixed back to the way it used to be. If fixed would be all 5 stars.",
        "I'm fed up of this game taking away my energy but not even putting me in a race! And I don't even get reimbursed for it! It connects and puts me in a race sometimes but nobody is there.... or sometimes it just glitches before putting me in to the race.......... sort it out. I'm deleting this bull.",
        "Few glitches where it takes fuel, then never starts a race search.   But it isn't bad if I've played every day since I downloaded it.  34 consecutive days so far!"

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘",
        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "I think this is better then all ur other games in SO many ways. Although, I was wondering if u could add more animals than the wolf, fox and lynx. You could add maybe a deer, tiger and African wild dog?  Tysm if u do!",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅."

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren't too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",

BUT may photos temperature started to climb and quickly shot through the roof to a point where it literally burns you! And it kills your battery! For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.",
        "Great time waster, I've been checking in on it every day for about a month. My biggest problem with the game is that there aren't enough prestige balls, once you get thunder there is almost no incentive to keep playing. I hope that more prestige balls are added in some future update. Otherwise, this is a flawless mobile game. There aren't too many ads, the graphical design is very simple yet effective, and the draw to keep coming back lasts for a long time. It takes a WHILE to get all 5 prestige balls.",
        "Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I've got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?",
        "This is a cute little fun game but it keeps crashing I can't even open it so therefore that's why you got such low reviews. I was having a lot of fun with it until it started crashing. Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.",
        "Game play is alright but the adverts are annoying! Especially ones where come back on the game to get points: you can watch video for x2 the amount or just collect... Even the just collect end up watching a video! So might as well just have as x2",
        "Looks BORING at first. But I can't put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn't work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left"

        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I've made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new \"club wars\" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There's always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don't have to spend real money to play the game, but I'll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I've even started a second city on another device with my other email.",
        "The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(",
        "Really started loving it but, it's so highly optimized that it would make u bound to buy simleons-cash. Thus the game becomes super slow for u unless u pay and eventually booooring.   When u r in need of an item, the game wont show that item on global HQ. U will hav to play the game knowing the fact they r makin u to suffer so that u give them dollars."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.",
        "I play solitaire to look busy in public. My brow furrows a bit so it probably looks important. I have social anxiety. I was informed that a 5* review would let me bypass ads, which are sometimes loud and totally give away the fact that I'm doing something useless."

        "This game was great. WAS. I go to the bottom islands to expand my empire. And the trip was easy. So I conquered an island or two and ddcise to head back to get easy kills and more wood. In less than a quarter of the way there, 4 ships or attacking me. And they have different flags(also mabey add factions and allies) that only attack me. If there is a set number of ships spawned, THAT NUMBER IS TOO DANG HIGH!!! Now this game sucks.",
        "Needs improvement like alliance to other ships, trading with other ships not making them all your enemies, landscape mode (the graphics is all good), Base/Headquarters where we can dock ships and get some stocks not buying all with in game gold. Boarding mode when fighting the enemy so that you can take the enemy ship not destroying them all.",
        "Please make updates so you can fire your guns when you choose to. Also can you make it so you can pick a battle formation for your fleet? Just so your own ships don't crash into you whenever you steer. Other than that it's great.",
        "One side of my ship is very accurate, the other side cant hit an damn thing. It ALWAYS misses. Please fix this big. Its really annoying",
        "It's passable really. Am I expected to believe the $499 currency pack is \"hot\". I can't tell if the dev is either too greedy or just dumb. And also the $400 of once per week, this game has nothing close to that value worth spending. Other than that it looks like they aren't taking advantage of the boat resets since it isn't difficult to stay alive or any other reason to use them. I have like +70 of them saved up without spending a single cent in this game. Gameplay gets boring after a good half our. Islands are all the same stuff expect for looks. You could have prices vary here and there to add some sort of shipping and trading system but eh. Well, simple, easy, fun game."

Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "When I updated it to this new version. my profile got automatically reset . I was on lvl 71 with all of my squeezers full upgraded except two of them.. I had saved my profile on google play. But it was showing my previous save when I was on lvl 36 ... this is tooo baad.. I am hating it"

        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game 😊",
        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "This game is very addicting and so fun to play. Some are challenging and can be hard if you don't spell the word correctly. I only wish we got 60 seconds. Some of the categories consist of longer words and some people can't type that fast. But I do love this game, just not an ad after every round."

        "Unfortunately the game is really UGLY! The concept was good, the individual wood blocks are nice and minimalistic but then the developers pasted giant horrendous comic sans-ish fonts all over and we now have a game that needs a paper bag on its head. The gameplay also ends far too abruptly, no chance to assess your final screen and see your errors. Just so very ugly... I mean aesthetically displeasing.",

Now i got 2 games both linked to Facebook but no way to continue the old game data on the new one. Oh with surprise its not even on gamelofts sit. Please help",
        "I love this game and would like to keep playing. But since the update I couldn't get into my stadium, the game would crash. Now, it won't even open. I even uninstalled it then reinstalled it, but it won't even open. It's just a black screen then back to my home screen. So, I loved it, but I can't even play it, so I guess I have to delete it :'/",
        "It's pretty cool. Definitely has a little challenge at beginning having to wait for the resources to be made for everything. I'm gonna play it for awhile to see if gets better. Graphics are alright but game control is little touchy when placing new buildings.",
        "Well I was really enjoying the game until it was time to expand my storage (in lvl 7). The arrow pointing to the storage button with the guy on the left saying this one's free and I can't click on anything. Like it's frozen, but not frozen because things still get highlighted when going by them. What's the problem here?! Restarted my phone, cleared junk and other apps, ???",
        "i bought some resources using real money,when i enter the game it went jammed cant move anything ,cant play. i deleted it and reinstall the game,it starts from the begining . i lost everything...so lame"

A full out weapon maker, doesn't matter if its melee, rpg, nuke, fireworks, u name it  you create it. And Mabye have a option to upload our creation to a user area so can download other peoples creations, if not then ok, but I really want a weapon maker in this game. It would be cool. Great game I really love it, can't wait till the next update.",

Also wish you got more than one gem at the end of each episode. It takes a really long time to get those up when you don't have the money on a card to buy more. Just a suggestion. This is the only \"game\" app I use anymore I have a ton of games downloaded on my phone and I only mess with this one.",
        "I love it, but some stories are very inappropriate.Also story's don't really get new chapters quick enough because I go through them so fast. It truly is an amazing app that is so addicting. Good Luck on not being able to control yourself. Also, tickets don't replinnesh quick enough. Sorry about spelling.",
        "It's such an amazing app but you need to know how to find good stories. I spend my time \"reading\" the stories and it annoys me when my passes run out but thank God because if not I would never leave my phone. One of my favourite apps ever",
        "I hate how it advertises that you get to choose your story but everything takes so many gems. Why? I know you need to make money somehow but you only get 1 gem per chapter and each story takes at least 50 gems if you want to choose the good choices. Very disappointed. Also when I first played this game you got 5 free passes and now it's only 2. What the hell!",
        "This app is amazing. I have been trying to find an app like this and finally I found it. I love how you can just sign up for free and create your own story's without using money. This app is a dream come true to me. I've had it for a year now and it is still my favorite app. It's like a game of life. 5 stars for You!",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME!! currently writing my own on the app!! Love that update♡ definitely my favourite app ever!! Only an add at the start of story witch is grand👌Only bad thing is you have to wait a long Time for passes to refill &  some choices cost way to much! .defo download now!!"

Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.",
        "The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.",
        "One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It's interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that's there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate"

        "Awesome game there's a lot of people saying this game lags it doesn't it a very relaxing and fun great job to the ones who made this game I never have problems with this game works great for me",
        "Well this game is better then most farming games i have played. The crops dont die is a major plus for me . The only thing i dont like is the wait time for things i think there to long at times. But other wise one of my fav games . Love the notification sounds there fun and i really enjoy the club that u can join find a good one like i did and u have a bunch of nice and helpful ppl. Would recommend playing this game and all the others tjis company makes",
        "I've been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I've played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don't have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game."

        "I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I'm not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain't getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold",
        "When it's not crashing, it's fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn't load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much."

        "This games accuracy is worse than my atari 2600 and is 1000 times worse than my 5200. It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",
        "It's a good game. However the pricing needs some work. I  started with 4 tokens paid  $4.99 for 300. Now I have just 150 tokens after beating \"Plotted\" and the next one. And the prizes are so small that it's pointless to even try to win them. There's nothing wrong with making money but this game as it is may be too expensive for me.",

Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!",
        "The one and only terrible thing in this game is the energy system. The fact that you need to wait for half a day for the energy bar or to recharge is just way too much...  I would suggest having the quest to cost half the current energy.  The rest is okay to me"

        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it's enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don't go no further, they make you money but you're maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good",
        "Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!"

        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "I will give a better review when I get the chips and rewards points I paid for. Its been 3 days now and no reply email to my problem with no chips/but I paid issue. And during this time I cannot play the tables I would have been able to do so. Hurry up!!!",
        "Need to stop people from making it impossible to win buy betting so high you can't play because they Jack the bet so high.Not fair to those of us that are trying to play a fair game.They get all most all their chips by basically cheating to rest of us out of ours.           Need to have a section that explains how some of these games are played and the rules.",
        "Pretty much agree with most if not all the nagative reviews. And thanks to a fellow reviewer am switching to zynga poker. The amount of ads is rediculous. Let me just so no to 6 different ads in a row as soon as i log in. Ill be sure to not contact your \"concierge\" and move on to something better. Maybe an app that actually appriciates feedback.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.",
        "You guys nailed it with this app. ;) It may not work properly for every phone out there but for mine it runs smooth and goreish to the max! Too bad we can't use our previous upgraded rides passed by level but overall.. 5 stars!"

        "Damn good game. Great concept created a game with very good graphics and game play and made a lot of people think there actually playing and competing with other players. I do love this game but I would love it even more if I was actually playing against real people instead. Don't try to make me believe the other players in the game are real all someone has to do is uninstall and reinstall the game to see. Wow same strongholds with the exact same stuff to steal but totally different players. Again still good game but I will no longer put real money into just to play with myself. Instead I will use fake money lol",
        "this game is very cool but seriously you really have to spend money to enjoy it fully.The energy system is garbage and walking from place to place is tooo long... seriously 24 MINUTES,also inventory space is insanely limited and it wants you to spend money for more slots. I understand you have to do this in a free game but please don't make the game unplayable becouse of that. I still hope this game will be better in the future becouse i enjoy my time playing it",
        "Great game, restrictive on recipes, needs to improve learning them better. Durability can improve with repair proficiency. Lower proficiency lower durability,  houses could have durability consistent to material. Stronger longer lasting. Anything and everything on enemies gatherable would be awesome, i.e clothes off walkers armor off knights. Environment growth above dungeons could be progressable. Never completed dungeon no growth completed many times a knight.  Fishing would be nice. Hire vendor would be great in player compound. Upgradable structures is cool. Learning them.",
        "I love it! It's a wonderful game,  well made and had beautiful traffics graphics but, the energy recharge is slow,  which makes playing the game longer than 10 minutes impossible. Plants should grow back as well as trees after a certain time. I also made two purchases and never received them. I bought talons and a weapons cache. Please give me my weapons or my $8.99 back.",
        "Its a good game actually, BUT...  * You need to make trees grow at your stronghold. *Need to have deers roaming once in a while in yr stronghold. *Energy regenarating needs improvement. * You should be able to gather seeds from your plantations *Should have rain collector,ponds, lake or rivers to get water and to fish for food. * Maybe berries that grows within ur stronghold area. * Energy spending is to fast that makes us play for just five to ten minutes only. * You should design a game that is enjoyable to play by giving us more time to play it, not everyone can afford to buy with real money. Hope you can make changes so that we can continue to support you. Thanks.",
        "Very addictive. I'm a big fan of both your games &lt;3! Awesome graphics, awesome set up, everything g is awesome! I can say some resources are hard to get tho esp a well. But other then that its pretty cool! I've just started so I've notgonna do a whole lot yet. Went to a yellow area once but man so not ready for that.. Also seems like I can't never keep stuff to heal me or even find it? Keep up the good work!!"

Game freezes... never during a 30 second commercial, right after you get the bomb or whatever... so you lose it... then to have the games you go back to get the 3rd star... now you always frees it at the end, then offer to play one more for another commercial... not happening",

        "App freezes in mid play. The commercials are horrible. You can't do anything without a Dove hair    commercial.  Please fix this game so it stops freezing up !  I can't even play anymore.  Why don't you read these reviews and fix this issue.  I have you but you keep asking for the same information.",

        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game."

As a result it's been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it's not required I'm not installing it. Other than that complaint it's actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.",

The method of saving game scores leaves MUCH to be desired, as well as changing and editing profile photos. Notice my photo is (was) displayed 90° out of vertical. So I give the game 4 out of 5 stars in hopes of encouraging the edit functions to be reworked and made more user friendly.",

Also u should add a rover that can be launched off a ship and used to explore planets. On top of that u could create landmarks on planets such as caves or something! Overall a great game but would love to have more content! P.S any estimated date for when next update comes out?",
        "The creators could really make some improvements. For example i've made a space station that can latch onto other ships, however I can't get any other ships close enough to latch on. We should be able to set other ships as targets so we can latch on or whatever. Also perhaps add wheels so people can build rovers that can land and travel on different planets. The gameplay is not too hard but not easy all you need to do is look at the tutorials and you are set and the graphics are good.",
        "So I've been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you're on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!",
        "I love it. The greatest game ever keeps your brain from stopping because this game is like a puzzle you need to think smartly, and build smartly. I want to thank you, from making this MASTERPIECE free. Please don.t ever add in game purchases not everyone has credit cards. You guys should download this game if your are bored. If does not takes up many spaces and ultimate fun and creativity.",
        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "This is such a fantastic game, it's so easy to use, but also it requires skill as well. An issue that I have is the the lack of function, like if you could build functioning satellites (mine consist of a frame and landing legs), maybe even rovers. Additionally, a larger building space and re-entry effects would be great. I am aware that you are most likely working on some/all of these issues. Finally, when do you expect the next big update will be?   *Sorry if this doesn't make sense"

        "I hate this app. :( I already have a farm, but the app wants me to start over! It forced me to start over, and there is no log-out button. I've spent quite a bit of money on this game between my account and my partner's. So i can't use this app because my 40,000 gold would be gone. back down to the 400 they srart you with. booooooo edit: also, the BF website won't allow me to play on my new laptop at all, because it is run by android. it re-directs to this app, which i am uninstalling. i'm not too happy.",
        "Loved it until I spent hours and a bunch of money trying to get to level 11. The XP points for stuck and wouldn't turn over saying I needed 1 more XP to level up. It kept flashing \"level up\" with fireworks, etc., but the game wouldn't register anymore XP no matter how many tasks I completed. Totally Annoying! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",
        "Dev team: It's important to note that there's consistently errors when calculating numbers for the cherries and wheat project. I've taken screenshots to prove that we have completed the project but are not ever getting credit for doing so. Please reply if you'd like those pics and more importantly please fix this issue asap.  Thank you!",
        "I  have been banned! !   I read about them banning players who did not deserve it last year too. I have not done anything to deserve being banned. This tactic must be illegal. It was my fav game, but they never respond and I am done with playing these games. I not a hacker ,cheater, or abusive to anyone.  Don't even start this game, something is rotten.",
        "I enjoy this farming game most of all the farm games I have played. It is a bit frustrating that a few things cannot be upgraded without spending real money, but it doesn't keep you from playing the game.",
        "The game it's self is fun however they apparently don't support there game. I have sent several emails regarding missing gold and money they don't respond . So play the but don't count on getting what they say today I lost 200 gold and never got 150 gold for achievements that they said. So tired lightly and don't spend any real money"

Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don't bother as you won't get it",
        "I love the game, if you get it, join my clan, the tag is TsWs_ and the clan name is Thor's Warriors_ please join. I change titles when ever a new player joins. I've had Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Lords Mobile and they take too long but  War of Clans doesn't take too long! I highly recommend this to everyone no matter if you're a boy, girl, child or adult. AWESOME advert/trailer!",
        "This was a game that I played for a long time. The server to the game messed up and I lost all my troops that I worked hard to get and the only thing that plaruim could tell me is that it showed that I put a 24hr shield on but it fell off 3hrs after I logged off the game. They would not fix the issue or reimburse me my troops that I lost. Do not waste your time or money with this company. It's a shame that a bad COMPANY runs a good game",
        "The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.",
        "Just downloaded this game cause my friend loves it, and the game won't launch for me. I hope tech support gets back to me so I can adjust the rating but keeps saying connection lost when I have 150mb speeds at home and even on cell signal, nothing. I have a Samsung s7 with android 7.0",
        "I'm not happy with this app any longer. I installed it through another app which then failed to redeem the offer that it required for installation. I am very disappointed that this happened. And when I filed a ticket with them, they told me it was rejected because I had no proof that I installed the game and did all the requirements. Never will I allow myself to install any apps from either party again. Nice doing business with you."

        "The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn't die??!!! and that's a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it's perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!",

        "This amazing sad that you need to buy the levels though but nice goats this is funny and ridiculous but I love the the game this made me laugh so put a multiplayer so you can join people and instead of getting your goat at a customize so we can make our own goat I LOVE THE GAME 😄😄😄 oh I'm still typing ahhhh"

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads",
        "A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine's) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I'm unsure it this is the game or my phone.",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long."

        "Awesome game! Love the art, love the music, love the style, and the gameplay is actually challenging enough to hold my attention but not enough to be irritating. Perfect difficulty. Not to mention the colorblind mode actually works. I know this is receiving a lot of criticism, but I love the option you guys gave with ads and how well you executed it, that was a very nice touch. You really outdid yourselves with this one!",
        "This title should be moved in the puzzle category in my opinion! Charming story with beautiful low-polygon graphics... Etc! Nevertheless, the game is very short to complete... If, you are not interested in completing the game achievements! There are not enough worlds and levels (right now) and I expect new ones in future updates... Eh! I would certainly convince more mobile gamers to purchase the full game (with unlimited lives and no ads) at 3.99$ CDN. Regardless, I purchased the full version of this game to support one of my favourite Canadian gaming app developer on the Google Play store... 👍😉",
        "A very decent small game. I don't know what other people are complaining about but you can play the game without paying. The music is nice the graphics is nice it's easy to play. I hope there more levels in the future as this is such a fun game. Very nice one from the team at noodlecake Studios. Kudos my n*****",
        "Amazing...simple and superb theme... The music the game play and the concept everything different  from usual boring games .......I give 100/100.......the team who made this game having a  good potential to bring something new..I excepting more games from this crew..best of luck and all my wishes to gys",

        "I 9/10 love this companies games however this game has Flaws. You will have nothing that hits the bottom and it will say game over. I am not happy with it ! The ads literally make you click on it and then take you to Google Play store to download it which is very annoying. I would not download it not a good one.",
        "Way too many ads. Every two games you get 30 seconds of advertisment. At one point an ad popped up during my game and made me lose. Played this for 5 minutes and uninstalled, dont even bother to download the game.",
        "Like previous reviews said; great game but the problem is with the ads. I PAID for the ads to be removed and it did nothing. In my opinion an ad after every game is over kill. Like the other Voodoo games. Have the ad bar like every other game, then when someone hits the save me button that is when you force someone to watch the ad. It's a give and take scenario that has worked very well for other games. I'll waste 30 secs of my life to have a second chance but I will not after every game.    I am very annoyed that I paid money to remove ads and they didn't fix it. Ratings like this will continue if you do not fix this issue asap",
        "I always play games with music in the background and while playing this game my music would be constantly shut off because of the ads, I don't mind the ads themselves, just the fact that it constantly interrupts other sounds playing on the system is very irritating. Gave you 2 stars for a nice game, didn't play a lot though so couldn't tell you more.",
        "I paid to get ad free.....STILL HAVE ADS! I like the game a lot. But if you have a button that gives you the option to pay for NO ADS, then you should get what you PAID for. The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",
        "I paid for the game, because why not? I enjoy VooDoo's games. But please tell me as to why even though I purchased this particular game I'm still getting it riddled with ads? And it's already beginning to to tick me off. Come on, fix this. I understand the ads if I wamt to continue my score, but I paid for pop-ups and other ads to dissappear entirely. It'll get a better score when the issue is resolved."

I expect at least an epic. I placed 5th and got a common potion and this was not the first time that happened. Give people incentives and proper rewards and they will keep playing the game. Come on man.",

I'm not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that's just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!",
        "This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",
        "I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the 'X' button it shouldn't show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!",
        "Need to open up the other 2 events, it can get boring only doing floor and uneven bars. This is a fun game but need more options to keep the player engaged. For charging $10.00, we should have full access.",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "Love everything about this game!!! At first I was skeptical, but then once I started playing, I fell completely in love with it!!!! The only downside of the game is that I am waiting for the other challenges to open so I can compete. Other than that, this game is great overall...5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

The actual game plays ok, but not really anything special.

Stay away from this game until they change the permissions they are asking for.  Ridiculous.",

        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",
        "I love the game it's fantastic but one thing can you please have the feature to ride the vehicles or make your own customer vehicle and could you please add where the ninjas are actually following your character",

You'll be in s timed level and you lose time because you can't see under the words.  Some levels its ridiculous to have to do them 15 times to pass it",
        "I think there is difference between hard to solve or impossible. To get diamonds in order you should be able to get them. As example. Need to get circle first then triangle. But you cant get triangle unless circle is moved first. And mission failed because you didnt get diamonds in order. This is repeats over and over again. This is impossible to solve. I even had to deal with triangle being right down at the bottom. And all other diamonds at the top. I failed of cause. I am giving my view because I fed up with this stupid idea.",
        "I really love this game. But expeditions are more fun then the game itself. I really wish we could actually finish the expeditions instead , of not getting to finish the story behind them. Also during the expeditions to buy things are way to expensive because the amount of maic it takes to remove one item. Pls address these issuea. Really hope to see some expeditions we can really have fun and finish with.",
        "Love this game, been playing for more than a year now... Some of the levels are at times VERY challanging and rigged to fail over and over which can be annoying but eventually you get through. LOVE the expidition mini game as it is lots of fun but the 200 star limit is a bit low. Also found that at times I would use all my 200 stars to get rid of a rock that takes 250 stars to remove and when I come back to do the rest, it has reset back to 250 instead of only having 50 left like it is meant to. Please see if this is not a glitch and fix if possible.",
        "This game is great except for a few glaring exceptions. The timed levels are not fun and make me want to stop playing the game altogether. When you HAVE to use multiple bonuses to beat a timed level, it makes me want to quit.  The best part of the game is definitely the expeditions, but the 200 energy cap is too limiting when many objects take over 200 to destroy.",
        "Love the different puzzle styles that go along with the basic mahjong matching game. It gives an extra challenge to completing each game. Sadly I have only gotten to 250 levels after a year or 2 of playing because the puzzles are constantly rigged to lose. I am not a cash player as I have more important living expenses to spend money on so buying power ups and such are not an option for me. Would be great if there weren't so many losing games one after the other. I'm referring to the ones where you get to the last couple of tiles and the gems needed are at the very bottom so you are made to match the 4th set of gems when you are supposed to match the 3rd set first. I get multiple games where the matching tiles are stacked on top of each other so it requires a shuffle to win. As I said I am not and refuse to cash shop on a game that is not worth spending money as it is not a necessity so it would be nice to be able to progress without 10-15 losing games in a row. The spinning wheel doesn't always have ads available and I rarely get power ups from it. I mainly get paws."

Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",

        "There is some sort of bug with the raiders' quest that requires to make a set of tactical armour, I made 5 sets even tried after the 1.7.10 update and it was still not completing the quest and now I'm stuck unable to do raids, and I wasted so much supplies on cloths I don't even need.  Please help, would be much appreciated.",
        "***UPDATE*** I absolutely love the game. I even have my Wife and Son playing on seperate devices. My most recent suggestion would be to have trading of items between players with a code through chat. Only players that share the same code can talk and trade items. The item can come as a gift by the welcome mat or the Healer can bring it. Any thoughts to rebooting Bravo Bunker? Or making other spots available for items? Booth in front of Bunker? Maybe we can find a key?",

Problems always the same. And still can't Fix it! ... Again! WORST DEV'S OF ALL TIME!!! ... Various bug fixed ?,, Nonsense updates ... Go call for help on Grim soul's Dev's they know how to Fix it fast for sure ...",
        "Great game and concept. But, As many players said already, crafting parts is too expensive and takes too long, i'd appreciate a bit cheaper. Also, i have purchased a pack and spend £xxx for special things, however got killed in 10 min and lost EVERYTHING. I mean really? There should be some grace period after you die (10-15mins) to get back to this place and grab you staff, at least the cloths as these are quite expensive to craft every time. Also  durability of clothes is very poor...after 10 min of exploring and fighting,everything on minimum. Please, improve this and the game will be the best and also I would not mind to spend more money. Many thanks. You doing great so far.",
        "rate this game 9/10. the reason for this is the controls can be a little bit wonky and the game can lag a lot at points. other than that I have no problems with this game."

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I've ever played"

But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "This is the best game ever I saw for farming. It haves the controls amd graphics. But still theres problem that whenever I purchase any tractor and sell it after I want another tractor then I cant purchase it. The option of purchasing becomes blur. So please make it better. If I will not see any improvement than I will less the stars rated. Regards Jagdish Gadhvi",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

The only thing i dont like but understand is that you cant have unlimited lives unless you pay but it makes sense because without in app purchases the app wouldn't be what it is to day.",
        "I love this game!! It is fun! But I have a problem, when I finish a level and go to the next one, the next level still says locked!! Oh no!! So I am stuck on the 3 level... 😭! But I have fun playing!",
        "This is by far the best game I have ever played. I absolutely love the graphics, controls, and the gameplay. I like that it is challenging but fun at the same time. If I were you I would suggest you install  this game.",
        "The game recently has network error whenever I try to play any level and I have a very good Wi-Fi but nothing works at all except a few levels .please fix this .thanks in advance",
        "This game is awesome I love this game it's great and has spectacular graphics so many levels if you ask me it's similar to geometry dash",
        "The game is super fun and challenging... And I like both of those types of games😆 Anyways, great job Cheetah Games!!! 😉👏👏👏"

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don't waste it here. Good luck!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it's not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine's event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not."

        "Hey popcap, I think someone is hacking the system in Battlez. He got a head start RIGHT when the zombies appeared！Only 2 zombies came out and he got 1500 points！ this is definitely unfair. The worst part is, he was only using jurassic marsh plants！By the way, zombies killed near the start only gives you 500 points, not 750, so it’s unfair. Also, he had a hypno-shroom icon. Forgot his name.",
        "So how is it fair to match someone with L1 plants against my L4? How come someone with L5 plants thrashed me with 5 x my score but they don't appear in my league? Lots of work to do here. Rubbish at the moment",
        "Great game but all my progress was reset after playing for about 4 years. Waste of time to start again, I have heard many others which have suffered similar issues. Fix it.",
        "A really very nice and addictive game. Nice work with the new upgrade of battlez. Although I tried so many times, still couldn't login using my play store id. Love it anyways.",
        "Great game for small breaks.  But after having played for years, unlocking everything, after latest update, all my progress is gone. Second time it has happened, this time I won't be starting over again 😑 Please fix.",
        "It's good,but please fix the bugs (quests being completed without me doing anything,Balloon Zombies returning to their original state after popping their balloons sometimes,pinata trackers not appearing etc)"

        "This game is awesome and addictive. My second First Person Shooter Game After Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation.  I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this.",

And i have to wait for freakin 3 hours just to wait for it to download and another 3 hours for the multiplayer",

        "Das Quiz bricht mitten drin ab und funktioniert nicht mehr, musste App schließen und habe Fragen verpasst da bei Quizduell alle drei Fragen ja auf einen Haufen kommen, was übrigens sehr nervtötend ist und mir nicht gerade Lust darauf mach es öfter zu spielen. Und im großen und ganzen hängt die App sowieso sehr oft. Dafür das ARD soviel Geld hat, sollte man meinen sie könnten eine wenigstens mehr oder minder funktionierende App erstellen lassen. Schlechteste Game App die ich je hatte. Hoffe nach den ganzen negativen Reviews wird daran irgendwann einmal was verbessert.",
        "Live mitspielen funtioniert gar nicht",
        "Bitte mehr Notifications, wenn man dran ist, bzw ne neue Frage kommt. Beim Duell kann man vor der Finalfrage nicht zurückgehen, um sich den Spielstand anzusehen, häufig bleibt die App auch hängen....  Finde die App grundsätzlich gut, aber es gibt noch viele Kleinigkeiten und technische Probleme.",
        "Es werden keine Fragen eingeblendet, wieder gelöscht.",
        "Die App reagiert sehr zeitverzögert, was noch das geringste Problem ist. Teilweise darf ich gar nicht mitraten, weil die Frage mir nicht gestellt wird, teilweise wird die Frage nicht Mal eine Sekunde lang eingeblendet und dann war sie wieder weg. Punkte werden mir erst gegeben wenn ich die App neustarte. Die 2 Sterne gibt es für die Idee und die Sendung. Die Umsetzung ist sehr schlecht, bitte überarbeiten!   Edit: die angesprochenen Fehler habe ich jetzt nicht mehr bemerkt. Dafür trat ein anderer auf: mir wurde die Frage gar nicht gestellt und sofort rot markiert und ich konnte nachgucken was die richtige Antwort war (ohne das die tv-show schon soweit gewesen wäre). Nachdem ich die richtige Antwort wusste, wurde mir die Frage dann doch gestellt und ich konnte antworten. Punkte habe ich dann auch bekommen",
        "Die App ist im grossen und ganzen gut. Allerdings sind Fragen zum Teil einfach verschwunden, bevor man überhaupt die Antworten lesen konnte. Das ist sehr frustrierend besonders, wenn man die Arbeit weiss."

        "I really wanted to like this game. Fun game in concept with really adorable graphics. Its a shame its basically another \"money burner\" game with levels (past 50) you cant get past without using costly boosters (ex, 2 boosters cost $2.50 worth of coins). There is absolutly no reason you shouldnt be able to beat the higher levels without spending $5+ a level to advance.",
        "Am not much on matching games but this one I felt compelled to comment on because it's much different than most. It's whimsical, very cute and animated. I think children would certainly enjoy this game quite a bit but is also adorable and entertaining for adults. If you like matching games you need to download this game, I'm sure you'll agree it doesn't disappoint. 👍👍",
        "I used to LOVE this game... But then they added ads in the game every time your screen changes! I get you need ads to make money but it's ridiculous with this game. In addition they are the video ads that blare and made a scene too. I'll sadly be uninstalling the game now. I'm so disappointed.",
        "Excessive ads to the point where I get them if I accidentally tap pause and after every level. It's another candy crush style game with levels locked behind Facebook friends, money, or patience.",
        "I like the game but when doing the daily quest (fb) it will NEVER let me get to the end. It always resets! Very frustrating. Please fix!",
        "It is kind of fun, but a lot of times in the middle of making connections between the tiles it just stops and you wasted one of your little moves. Some levels are really easy others are not really manageable without coins, which leads to the problem, that the 'free' game will get you to buy it anyways....."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "I've been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn't even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.",
        "Game is good graphics are also good but it tends to get crash several times when I played it. I have a moto g5 plus phone with 4gb ram and adreno 508 GPU and all the games played very smoothly in my phone even asphalt 8 also ,i don't think so it's my phone who is not handling the game so there should be some bugs in this game  please fix as soon as possible.",
        "The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don't close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid."

        "The game is great. However is pretty sad that see no update on this for 2 months time. And within this period there are some players still able to upgrade the armor and weapon by real money. It do make me feel like giving upon this game now.  Thanks for update, the game look more 3d and better effect... Now is waiting for chapter 3.haha",
        "I love the series more and more with every installment. Great game, with simple aesthetics and a fun way to coklect gear and powers. The animations are rag-dolly sometimes but other than that it's perfect. I have one suggestion for Nekki. Why aren't you guys making games for consoles? You're too advanced for mobile. You could be the future mortal kombat sensation.",
        "Graphics are awesome, it controls and plays very well. Fights are slick and intense with wonderful animation that makes great use of slow-mo to highlight big moves and finishing hits. The only real barrier to me giving this a full hearted recommendation is that there are microtransactions ALL OVER THE PLACE. If you don't like those distracting you constantly, not the game for you.",
        "Simply World's best game. This is the best game I Have played. Good graphics and amazing gameplay. But it's mission are pretty hard.I have a request can you please make a second name change because when I first started playing in excitement to play this game I had chosen a bad name and I wanted to change it. And I think like me many players had done this so please think about this.",
        "Loved the new BGM... ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Just one thing, please make the animation speed a little bit more fast. It's slightly annoying to wait that long for a window to open to show the equipments or switch between armour and equipments. Please note that.  But overall...it's the best game I've ever played. Kudos",
        "Nekki .. I don't know what's wrong with my app apk. I can't select the country, I mean Legion/Dynasty etc. There is a request which i want you to up upgrade asap in the game. I want you to add a option of 'Multiplayer' so that we can play the game with our friends too. Perhaps the game is awesome. Loved it."

        "Hill Climb meets Tank Wars. Simple but fun time-burner. You can upgrade your tank with in-game coins. Purchase option available but then you don't get to enjoy the challenge. Grind it out and earn those upgrades. Enjoy!",
        "Move forward, flip over and die Move backward, flip over and die Fire the canon, flip over and die Hit by another canon, flip over and die Ram a tank, flip over and die Rammed by another tank, flip over and die Sit perfectly still, flip over and die.  Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I'm happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!",
        "Very pay to win and matchmaking isn't great.  Matches new players against players with tons of upgrades.  I know that's a common tactic to encourage those new players to buy the better tanks with cash, but it just made me remove the game.",
        "Alittle bit boring but it has good graphits and makes the players exciting while beating at the enemies . However, to get more excellent tanks like Tesla , it takes so many long times and difficult to hore the coins. I wonder if this game is easy to get coins .  Bravo!"

Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it.

It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "Can you make the map bigger that you can own your dream house,a mechanic/ garge.Make  sticky bombs and upgraded weapons. Put jets and tanks in the military. Also make it a lot easier to gain money and gems lower the price on planes ect. ( the stuff that costs gems.)Also would like to sell some of my items for ither money or gems because ive git 4 baseball bats that i would like to sell and bring back the pawn shop. That's all!"

And I am not able to play the arena without the app shutting down several times, it's frustrating! I don't understand why the updated version is so bad.. isn't it supposed to be getting better with each version?",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "There is an extremely annoying ad that will freeze the app, I don't know what it is for, but it's animated, shows a city street, moving van, starts at 36 sec.  I can't leave it when it freezes, have to leave app entirely, go back to where I left. If I click again and same app appears I can't receive my reward.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "It's nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I've had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn't mind the ads but now after every level I complete there's a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level"

        "It's a good story and all. But I only wish they would let me save up energy or at least give me a little more. It gets frustrating when I can't Carry on, I'm not a patient person. Graphics are good. Controls are good. Story is great! Loving most of this game so far. I just hope they change the energy part of it. Though I guess it's a lot easier to read thn most episode stories.",
        "Love the game. Nice graphics and good storyline. But like everyone else, I agree with the energy problem. It's absolutely ridiculous! Plus the story just suddenly stopped?! Been waiting for 3 wks for it to start again. The app has updated 4 times the past 2 wks and nothing. Been so long, I forgot where it left off. Seems like a scam and a money grab. I spent a lot of money, and no more story? Not happy at all!",
        "Loving the story so far and the graphics.. It's all so beautiful. Only wish that they would give you more energy over time to read it.. when you lose time to read you lose interest in the story by the waiting. Help us stay interested!",
        "I love it! all though I can't help but wonder when the MC finds out they're vampires does she either go to Sarah's when she's on her period or just stays there? I honestly wonder how that whole scenario would play out.",
        "Please change the fact you have to wait a whole day for enery.. Make it every 5 hours or something I really enjoy it and not everyone has the money to spend",
        "What amazing graphics 1492 studio..........it's sad we don't get more energys alot of readers will soon get board or my favorite one is irritated as hell because it's takes no time to go through them then on top that u got to wait till following day what is that plzzzzzzz keep your readers happily interested!!!!!!!"

AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ❤👏👏",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player"

        "For a mobile rpg (free at that) it has a lot to offer and lots to do. Lot of grinding but very addictive and you don't need to pay to win! You can attain everything through grinding without having to spend any money at all.. 5 stars for sure.. It's my new time killer.",
        "This is one the best RPG phone games out. It is addictive and fun with lots to do at everyone point in the game. At the moment it is my favourite phone game. It is a bit complicated at the start, however you start to understand it more and more as you play. There is in game purchases but these are not necessary to enjoy the game. Definitely a 5* game! Only thing I find slightly annoying is that I never seem to have enough gold but this might change as I level up.",
        "I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I'm data only) and my tablet says the game isn't compatible. It's marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it's not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I'm not running a speed test.",
        "Requires some patience but is a really fun game. Don't expect to fly through the tutorial but they make it fun learning the steps. What I enjoy the most, is its NOT lagging down my processor with ads. Only thing I wish is that the home base was a little more organized.",
        "The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it's getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..",
        "Love the game, would give 5 stars, but lost 2 high-level characters and quite a bit of $ due to lack of anything resembling customer service. If you have to reinstall for any reason, and can't remember your password, be prepared to lose all progress because if you can't sign in right the first time, there's no way to sign out, or to contact someone to help recover your character."

        "Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea",
        "Good simple nd great stress buster but at higher levels there is glitch. I got to lvl 570+ and game hangs  and way too slow . Even number on cell exceeds its size.  I scored in advanced part. Hope developers do something about it",
        "This has been my fav gameeee I swear this game you will love, and fun with.Its so easy to play, in the first time I play, i got of a score of, 131 how cool is thattt!!!. I cant even image what the new score would be in the future. I swear DOWNLOAD this game u wont regrett!!!!💕",
        "Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I'd rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡",
        "Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.",
        "Great game, great time burner. Absolute !@#$ with the choice of skins for your balls, it doesn't let you view them and clicking on it instantly buys it. I've been lucky with the two I've bought but still an awful design."

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I really like the game. But there's one thing that annoys me: when I don't play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars"

        "Really good feature, free roam. But it needs an in-game chat feature because drag racing is a bit hard to do without it. Could add a global leaderboard for it as well but I'm in no rush for it to be asked immediately, but now with the multiplayer added, it's almost as good as Gran Turismo PSP. Nothing short of authentic real racing. Could add some more classics like the Toyota 2000GT and Nissan 280Z. A must-have game for real car enthusiasts. Another request is the addition of a real racetrack like Suzuka GP circuit and the Nürburgring Nordshleife circuit, the Nürburgring circuit is about 21 km long but that circuit in this game will make it totally unique compared to other driving sims that don't have it.",
        "MOST AWESOMEST GAME EVER!!!💯 The One thing the Game Had to do was Bring in the MULTIPLAYER MODE to make it Awesome.. & Yess!! They Did it. You will never Find an Awesome & Realistic Game as this in the Whole \"Play Store\".!!!!!  This Game is Built for Brilliance, with Real Copyrights from all the Manufacturers.   The Custom Lobby too is Brilliant.. as the Server is more Stabble, just Needs a Bit of Tunings for the Low Graded Smartphone (Due to Lags)  But Overall a Great Concept..!! If Your Still Reading this Review & Haven't yet Installed the Game, then Stop Reading this Already!!!! GO DOWNLOAD THE GAME.!!  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW OTHER AR PLAYERS AROUND THE WORLD, THEN YOU CAN ALSO JOIN INTO THE FACEBOOK GROUP CALLED AS ★ Assoluto Racing - Drift Club ★",
        "Best car physics I've found on android. In the single-player modes I've tried it runs smoothly on my old Nexus 2012 KitKat tablet. But there's a graphics bug: the asphalt of race tracks (but not city streets) shows as a perfect mirror image of the sky above, clouds and all! I can make rubber marks on it, though.[Edit - New version 1.20.2 hangs during startup]",
        "Gold Standard racing sim on Android. Period. Brilliant and logical gameplay. IAP's are abundant however unnecessary to successfully progress. Huge replay value. Top end graphics without breaking the CPU/GPU bank - butter smooth framerates, accurate physics model and gorgeous UI lend themselves to a racing experience that will NOT disappoint drivers.  Multiplayer support is solid and highly functional.  Have I mentioned the most important part? The cars - huge selection and growing with every update. Top Tier Developer.",
        "Are there rewards when you play multiplayer races? It keeps lagging when I finish online races and it just wouldn't continue, it just freezes there, please fix it. Overall this game is great but this multiplayer thing is really annoying, I've played more than 10 online races already and only got a reward ONCE....",
        "Very slow progress and there is a track that's impossible because the finish line doesn't work. Don't download this game unless you like buggy games with a lot of grinding/in app purchases."

        "Big fan of Beyblade since I was a kid, from the first generation. So this is cool to play this game and see how far its came. Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I'm gonna have to download because it won't open. Overall, it's a fun game when it's not glitching",
        "Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they'd at least be entertaining.",
        "I really like to play this game and I have played it for a very long time, I am very disappointed on how the game is going at the moment because whenever I put my old bladder Id, it keeps asking me to create new one and it is really sad because it keeps wanted me to change my bladder Id and restore code.😢😢😢 Sometimes also the color of the game is turning black only and it is truly sad to play this game like that. 😭😭😭 I really am enjoying this game but can you please fix my issues or respond back to me as soon as possible. I hope that you will do that. Thanks. 😔",
        "As much as I love Beyblade, this app is really disappointing. The gameplay isn't anything special but the worst is the players. There should be a serious punishment for disconnecting. I cannot enjoy the game - I should have won two matches but I got nothing for them because my opponents disconnected the last second. Truly unsatisfying.",
        "I know a trick to get all beyblades FIRST go to your computer SECOND search ,ALL THE BEYBLADE CODES IN THE WORLD, THIRD scan a image facing the code and get a new beyblade! it WORKS I SWEAR!!!!!",
        "Good game but add sprizen s4 and if you could be able  to controle were the beyblade goes and add a swordlauncher when is battle tower stadium cooking out and when is luinor L3  coming and the digital control coming out and if is possible add ring out finish and when theirs a draw that no one gets points instead and some more stadiums more speshol moves for beys but stell love the app👍👍👍"

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

        "Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn't have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn't let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars",
        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "If you are looking for a fun game, this is not one of 'em. It is so annoying. It gets me is mad that I've DELETED it twice. But... when you win the levels you feel like you have just met Jesus. Also, the first few levels are easy.",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it."

Drops(and buys) out of the sky like assisted aiming, x2 damage, x2 coins, Invisibility, move spawn, and Switch weapons during the fight. It would be really cool if you could add stickman customizations and online multiplayer. Great concept. Could add weapon upgrades as well. Amd thw adds are not a big deal. Only 4 stars because i feel like you could make it way better if you really wanted to.",

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "Constant crashes and the customer support team does very little to help. Good game but I wouldn't put money into it as when the game crashed (and it will) they tell you that there is nothing they can do to recover what you lost",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition"

I am so bored.Theres only a couple things to enjoy on it.Come on ,why can't you get this game together for Android users?",

        "I really enjoy the game so far but I have a few suggestions to help.  1.  Fix how we level up player skills.  Stopping the bar in the right place is annoying to do.  2.  Add more attacks like...a double back dash attack for your regular and power punch, a forward dash for the power punch and for the special skill when you get it, more combo button presses like light punch power punch light punch power punch etc.  3.  More characters.  I love the bone breaks it was a great touch.  I hope you keep updating this regularly",

        "More attacks, combo attacks, real damage if the arm is broken it should go limp and not work that would be cool,and can you please let people constantly and continue to hit the downed opponent after they already lost, you know extra cheap shots, more brutal honesty keep going I love it.",
        "I LOVE this game just as much as I do SOCCER HEADS,  great graphics, animations, bone structure system,  characters. But OVERALL just a really nicely done game developed by a really nice developer who knows his stuff. 🙃",

        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Decent. The game is close to curling. Issues are that the only real way to earn coins it to play online mode. If you do career mode you actually have to SPEND coins to play, and there's no payout for winning. The rocks don't behave like real curling stones, but it's the best curling game you'll find on your phone.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "i would have rated it higher til i was forced to start a new mission with Pooh Bear. all of my characters are having to do things not for the usual money to used to buy things i need to upgrade and expand my kingdom, they now earn Pooh bucks for the next 20 some odd days. not everyone likes to play a game that has forced side quests. i dont like some characters cost a lot of actual money to unlock. If a child is playing this and wants their favorite character, parents are having to shell out money to keep them happy. it should be either buy it or earn it.",
        "Grafics are amazing!!! Constantly wanting you to buy gems that help you move along in the game.  You can send characters on tasks that are suppose to drop needed parts you need to advance and they rarely drop. Not sure why different updates cause the game to crash more often. But again,  when it works, the Grafics are really cute!",
        "It was fun until it won't stay on long enough to do anything.  I have started it 6times this morning!!!  This has been going on for awhile but today crazy.. I am going to uninstall it if there is no fix soon..  I have played this game going on 2yrs.. very frustrating..it runs even worse since y The stupid update..thanks for nothing!!!!",
        "This game is really cute and fun. I greatly enjoy it. However, the resource cost jumps quickly to ridiculous rates and there is no ability to assist friends. I could get over the resource cost if friend visiting and helping were to be added. That would make this review go from a 3 to a 5.",
        "Awesome game. It's Disney and you don't have to stay on it all day unless you want too.lol. The only issue I would have is that it is very difficult to get some characters. I kept trying for Mulan all the way thru when she was available and never got her. Then i got treasure chests and got alot of stone dragons and no Mulan either. But I still love my Disney game. Been playing almost since it came out. Thank you for a wonderful game.",
        "You guys need to up the gems for watching videos 1 gem is just not enough, you guys are making it so hard to collect characters, it takes months just to collect a character worth gems it is ridiculous. Also for some reason since the pooh bear update began i keep getting kicked out of game play it is getting frustrating coz i actually enjoy playing this game. It brings out my inner child"

        "Game is really giod, with a nice and funny story campaign. What it lacks is the end game u only have 2 choises grind pvp or gring portals... it would be much better if guild was more involved like guild wars, or  all the dark souls members collecting goes fir a guold aswell, were u can use them in some ways... and i would really like story expansion ;) in short game is fun for a short term , but it has all it needs to evolve. Please do more guild involved in end game. Since at the moment all u can do in guold is trade resources and the game itself is pretty much solo.",
        "Don't spend a dime.  The latest update calls you selfish for cheating. They literally will punish you for playing too long. The farther you get, the more you are blocked from the good equipment, and the slower the progress.  They will push you to quit or gamble on new equipment by spending more $$  Servers crash constantly. Non existing customer service. Tournaments unavailable for   strong castles except a select chosen few who dont spend a dime.  Hundreds who work for the developer are the top clans and have access to taking all of your hard earned gold.",
        "Game is fun however, build times are ridiculous even with premium, premium feels underpowered and won't be renewing it unless there's a real reason to. Arena battles are way unbalanced. Legendary drops out of bought chests are ridiculously low. No option to buy arena gear with diamonds. Etc. Balance the game then we can see if I'll spend $",
        "The game is fun and has potential. But it dragged down by the system that requires you to wait for your fighters to heal after each battle, and you have to have premium in order to heal them fast, or you have to move your fighters around after EVERY battle, which last less than 1 minute. It's so stupid, after my premium runs out, ill probably not be playing anymore.",
        "It's alright. It takes along time to upgrade anything. Not only does it take hours at a time to upgrade and build things but it takes days to get enough coins to buy the upgrades. You should be able to upgrade or build more than one thing at a time without buying another builder. Upgrades to buildings shouldn't cost so much.   Other than that, it's a fun game.",
        "The new 6 hour feature is the dumbest thing I ever heard. Why would a game designer penalize players for playing! Guess it's time to find a new favorite game"

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "I love this game but please fix these: 1)Things in the same place when you die 2)The house is bigger 3)Show like a heart beat when Granny is near and not just foot step's. 4) A animal would be cool to help you around the house. 5)More weapons such as, Guns, Knifes, Ect. Lastly that when Granny steps on the bear traps she can get court to and maybe a Granddad! Other then that, This game is amazing and I can't stop playing and be glad to know my hole school is playing it and you hear it every turn you make! Not a joke! Keep it up!  =D",
        "This is an early game with a bunch of potential. I love the game and I'm always playing it but I feel like you can expand the game with these additions. Firstly, why not add in a collectible menu where you can hunt extremely hard-to-find collection of items within Granny's house. Also you could possibly add another, backdoor exit to the house. This would mean being able to escape a different way. Finally you could add another whole game mode where you escape the house in a different way. (You could even add in a whole new mechanic but don't make it too complex!)"

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game."

Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",

This is pure logic  huge or billionaire  casino..  you let us win big make us happy few days later we loose it anyway no one looses right? It's a cicle keep us the client happy and we for sure will come back every time.Its fake chips not real  guys. .  please give us a reason to come back for more. So sad I deleted  both my apps. When I go there I want  be happy not worry that my 17.7b will be gone in 60seconds playing Roulette",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",

        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "This game is fun, it is addicting. However because of the constant changing and the unfair advantages that some players get (not everyone has the same events, quests, or in game things) it's becoming less and less appealing. And the multiple device fix is a joke! EVERYONE had that advantage and they took it! Dumb!",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

        "I think WAR ROBOTS is amazing!  I love how you make all kinds of robots to put into battle! I like how the robots can have special defense's like sentry mode and sheilds.  I also think it is cool to have different battlefields and different robots to choose from! I like it when you make more robots for people to buy and put into battle. I wished that everyone would play this game. But, I was wondering if you could lower the prices for the special robots and guns? Thanks!  From, Julian🙂😎",
        "This gets one star until the matches are EVEN. I PLAYED AGAINST A RAIJIN ON MY FIRST GAME! Other than that, good game. But pay to win. Bit I'm level 21 and hadn't bought anything and only played for month. And to all those people who claimed to have lost thousands, WHY, JUST WHY, DID YOU SPEND THAT MUCH ON, ON A,  ON A GAME!",
        "Most of the players seem to get balanced out well, so games rely on some sound teamwork and strategy.. like the active chessboard on the Milenium Falcon in a New Hope with the game between Chewie  and C3-PO. Yeah, went there. Fun as heck. Just don't buy your way to the top tier... earn it through time and battles. Makes a victory with the team feel earned.. awesome job all",
        "Reminds me of the mechs from some Animes. Fun. Easy to upgrades mechs and weapons by watching videos and going into open battles. Haven't joined a clan yet. Been playing for about two months now. The only complaint I have is facing lvl 30 players with lvl 12 Mk II mechs and weapons that clearly belong in higher leagues. I understand Pixonic's loyalties lay with their paying customers first. Because it costs money  to develop new mechs, weapons, and maps.  But something needs to be done about the Tankers. A week in the LP queue doesn't seem to be enough to discourage Tanking.  I still believe that the game is fun. And I won't let cheaters discourage me. Sooner or later I'll be up there in higher levels myself.",
        "game keep disconnecting due to problems since last update  edited after reply from picnic  thanks  for the reply .    connection loss has decreased  for the past two days (update?)  anyhow this is great customer service and just for that you guys deserve a 5 star...great game  great service and maybe some disc bug but that is life and you seem to address them   I'm impressed",
        "This is the longest running game I have on my phone...so that should tell you something. It's fun don't get me wrong but it started out as a great game but has now changed to a 2 star game due to the fact that they keep on making it more and more a pay to play game. If they keep going down this route I will need to quit. I don't mind paying for a good game but in game purchases are getting crazy."

        "More or less meh, can do with or without. For this edit I've lowered my rating since after update. Sure clan stuff looks nicer and I was excited about the infinite scouts for videos, however that perk is gone. Really makes me lose interest since I'm not gonna pay to play. Not to mention it also recently got way more difficult to get gems and overall this game is getting pathetic.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "Only had the game a few days. Was going great till the update today and like many i hit the fetching player profile and it has a server error and cannot connect. Glad i haven't spent months on this game like others for this to happen. Hope the problem is resolved soon. It had become and addicting game.",
        "I enjoy almost every aspect, but I do feel they make it a little two difficult to get higher birds. I am more likely to spend a little money to upgrade a higher bird than to pay money to get one in the first place.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance."

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Can't create your own tanks,  things just get placed there and you can't move them. The game itself is okay,  but if you take more than two seconds to find a move you want to do,  it starts flashing a move hint,  and not the best move either.  Nothing different to make this game stand out from most match three games.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average.",
        "Cute,fun ,but you can't even design your own tank. It would be a much better game if some things were changed in favor of your players. Please let us design our on tank.I"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It's sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I'm uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout",
        "Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro..."

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you're trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "This game takes P2W concept to a whole new level. its ridiculously hard to get weapons that cost gold, even the ones that cost credits. you guys really need to give F2P players something to compete with...  Above all the game is fun to play! but it just gets frustrating sometimes due to P2W model."

        "Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "I really like this game!  The game feels so real. The text messages you send out and get are from your actual time! Oh to make the game more interesting...you go to the dial tone dial 893702 the erase it don't hit call. At the bottom it will say chat, settings, etc. Click on those then go back to dial tone and repeat. This will give you more \"money\" to buy more lives and stuff. This really helps make the game more interesting! I am currently addicted :)",
        "It is great, nice and interesting story that makes me keep playing. What really bothers me is the fact that the puzzle takes FOREVER to solve. I know that the farther you are in a game the harder it gets, but it's just not logic to collect 25 pieces of each color at a puzzle and they only throw you 15-20 pieces and in such little amount of moves. The only way to solve it is spending money buying hacks or having too much patience. I would have deleted it long time ago if it wasn't for the story.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I like the idea but the responses are off quite often. For example: \"Please don't hang up!\" -I'm here \"I don't know! Not a clue. Doesn't make sense and breaks the immersion.   It's another game similar to SIM - Sara is Missing, which I'd recommend for now. It's more polished and engaging. The characters are more distinct than in I Am Innocent.  This just seems to be designed to make you spend cash eventually, not because someone actually enjoyed developing it.",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for ages, I love the storyline to it and the interaction with the other characters - the only thing to make that better would be if we could submit our own responses rather than the two choices given. The puzzles I like, but it would be interesting to have different types of puzzles rather than the same one repeatedly.  Got to the witness protection part of the game and it has frozen on me. I have collected all stars but no interaction is coming up on the text screen so not sure what to do next!!"

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.",
        "Hmm, what to say? I enjoyed it thoroughly (and I still am enjoying it). It was far more challenging than I thought, and I enjoyed being challenged by it. After all, that's what the game's about, isn't it? It's definitely a great game overall, and I'm looking forward to seeing how much further I can get in it. Also, it's really fun to just throw a massive block at a puzzle when you're confused. Sometimes violence IS the answer, it seems.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent."

        "I downloaded this game in 2013. Deleted it cz they were really greedy. I downloaded again a few months ago and now deleted for good. The games are fixed, no matter how much you win they will never give u tokens. Very stingy, greedy and disgusting people. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. I understand that some apps are not free but you do not have to rob people to make money",
        "The game is fine. It won't take much of your time. So if you are heavy gamer then it's not for you. I really don't like the concept of tokens. Why have to pay money and token to buy players? But when sell player then I only get money not tokens. Why?",
        "Transfer market is totally unacceptable. How can lower level managers come to higher level players auctions. You have right to use real photo profile? If looks like all are faint account in player transfer market.",
        "I enjoy playing this game. I love how you can train young players to become superstars. I think that the new update to the squad menu isn't good at all and I preferred the previous version.  I would like it if you could earn some transfer tokens when you sell players  and if you could make multiple team sheet that you could easily switch between.",
        "I don't understand players morale policy in this game!?! When I beat opponent with 4:0, some of players drops one morale point, even if they had excellent stats. Shouldn't morale rise after good game. Most annoying is losing morale overnight. WHY????"

        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "It's honestly a fun game, and I'd love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it's just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that's a problem. I'm not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It'd be five stars if it didn't give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn't worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try \"Run\". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)",
        "This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot",
        "tbh it's a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that's my opinion) And I don't know if it's just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.",
        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups"

        "I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn't buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it's hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ♡♡",
        "Love this game! It's addictive! Great graphics! Could use an better \" how to section\".  Biggest downfalls are the some of the hatch times and breed times are very discouraging. I know they want to make money on the game and I do purchase in game items, but the amount if gems it would cost for these breed & hatches are a bit much. Not ready to give up though cause the game is great so I'll keep waiting it out for now. I would recommend the game for sure.",
        "This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn't much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it's a decent time killer. I haven't ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it",
        "Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don't think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I'd say download the game, you won't regret it 👍",
        "I think it's really good and I know a lot of people who play it. If you could improve it you could try adding something new like healing potions or things to boost your dragon in battle. But not long term things like the scrolls things like fireballs that can be used once until you buy another one or rage potions that boost their attack or defence.",
        "It's a great graphical dragon building game with given mechanics by Gameloft. The deadly flaws are those god damn advertising ads that plays in random certain time. It makes me want to kill and murder those half witted morons who implemented into this game while smoking some weeds."

        "I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can't find Bradinsky song. It's okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol",
        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don't download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now."

        "The art style is amazing. The Zen mode and overall atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining. My big issue is after resetting my progress once I completed everything. You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game.",
        "Its a simple game with very simple things but still is exciting to play. If you are looking for a little mental relaxation or peace and still be able to enjoy the adventure, then this is a perfect thing. There are things I would love to improve. For instance the landing - and background music should have a variety. Also the zen mode is a cool little bonus but the music volume should be greater than other sounds. Hope to see these improvements..",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "Loved the game, but I'm uninstalling.  It has ads, which is completely fine, but one of the most frequent ads is for final fantasy 15.  The ad forces you to play a round, which is slightly annoying.  However the ad close button doesn't work even after the ad is done.  Clicking on it instead takes you to the Google store download for ff15.  The only way out is to close and completely restart Alto.  I view this as basically a scam by the makers of that game than anything Alto is doing, since other ads work fine.  I can't review ff15 unless I download it, which I will definitely never do."

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "Great game, would have given it 5 stars but its a money trap. On the loaner cars (beat 5 days worth of events) you can keep the rare care, i have not made it past day 4 without spending real money. Plus they are stingy with gold for purchases, like $10 for a couple hundred gold that does not go far, probably a part of one purchase.",
        "This game used to be good when the controls worked bit ever since the update the controls don't and to work and its really getting on my nerves I worked hard to get where I was in the game and now it's all gone away due to the controls not working. Thanks for the waste of money jacka$$3s",
        "Great NFS game for mobile console. Got a plot for main storyline. Although not epic the progression and challenges keep things interesting. Mods are interesting part and player need not spend any in-game money for purchase. Completing certain milestones will unlock them for free. Game modes like Tuner trials, Car series, PvP and Challenge series keeps the game alive. Over all a great NFS game.",
        "Game has good mobile playability. Good for those toilet breaks. Excellent graphics and brand licencing. The onky persistent issue that requires addressing is the sound glitching when using Bluetooth headphones, playing the game in silence just isn't the same."

There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎",

I am on  stage 890 and have been wondering if i will ever get to the tree top. Review by player indicated that he is on stage 3410. That takes playing.",

        "I love this app because it's just enough of a challenge so it can be done without being boring or getting so frustrated your ready to throw your phone across the room.  It isn't rigged to fail like so many games today!  UPDATE:  I've just reached level 1,600 and still enjoy the game every much as I did from level 1!  I honestly can't say that about any other game.  This is a great game for just passing the time, or challenge yourself to get 3 stars by studying all possible ways to complete the task.  YOU choose how much effort to put into it.",

And it reapit the Number.  I don't know but some things wrong.  Sorry if ma I  wrong.!!!!   I like the old game. Sorry.  My English is not good.  Just tray to understand me what I mean.

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign."

And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what's the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time."

        "It's an OK game. I love the Just Dance games and how they encourage us to move more, but I feel like there's lots of room for improvement on this app, more devices should be compatible. I'd like to be able to use a second phone as the screen to play on, it would make the game a lot more portable. Maybe if there was a way to use a Kindle Fire as the screen to watch? Overall my biggest complaint is it's too hard to find a device to use as a screen. I don't hate it, but I would like more options to play, none of my devices seem compatible as the screen.",
        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "Ok really liked this more when it had a free song selection, even tho at the time I wanted more free songs.. Being able to play a song once you get the free coins 100 per day(extra 100 for watching a video)... The cost of one song on this app... Makes this app a little less enjoyable. I believe free songs need to come back, or maybe more free coins. My children enjoy this but not alot for under fives... Children songs need to cost less coins. Songs prices should definitely not be more than 100 coins.",
        "How can I say no to this game? It's my favourite game ever. I even have all the Just Dance games (except the kids ones) on my consoles, which are Wii, Wii U and Nintendo Switch. But anyways yeah, I'd totally recommend it. Don't forget to tell your friends, your pandas, vegetables and fruit Loops about it. Happy Just Dancing! ☺",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves."

Why can't we purchase the game so the ADS will be gone.  Just like any other apps.",

        "I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It's so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It's absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn't less if you don't. A high quality and fun game. I adore it",
        "As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It's not really fair for those who aren't of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there's a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)",
        "I love this game.I really do.It has brought me alot of joy. It's great fun and it's a guilty pleasure of mine. With that being said. Your Ranked Events are Not Excusable. I'm v7 so I have skin in the game as they say.. I will pass and when you stop your Ranked Events I will gladly change my review. No Excuse for a blantent cash grab you make a lot of money.",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I'm very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Really annoying when ads pop up and you have to start from scratch. That's really my only complaint about this game, but it's a big complaint. It sucks to feel like you get really far and then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of the game. This is a finished game not an interactive advertisement where it stops you from going further.  In all honestly it plays simply and I like it a lot but it needs some improvements.",
        "I like the game a lot but it would be nice if there was a way to take back or redo your last move. There's been times that while I'm playing, the piece I'm placing ends up 1 square off from where I wanted it to go. Situations like that is where a \"redo\" or \"do over\" option would be very helpful and greatly appreciated. If you were to add that, it'd be a 5 star game for sure. Also some other colors options that didn't cost money would be great too! Other than those couple of things, keep up the great work you guys!",

        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it."

        "This game has had a bumpy road after releasing a beta onto the market, things are looking better now, but plenty of build yet to go. This is a common team battle game clone aimed to soon be a PAY TO WIN GAME as developers dream of their $$$ millions. I am only thankful to play the beta BEFORE \"pay to win\" becomes common.  The best game feature is your base and the large array of buildings. Nothing else is special when it is just remove the barbarians/monsters of other clones while adding zombies here. Worst part is this games new advert showing totally zero of actual gameplay.",

        "Gosh. Just.... too perfect. It's almost like a rich girl's real life. Just shop and compete against some other people. Coco play is my fav game app... thing. Whatever you call it. But.. it has so much adds. Excluding the get for free things. Still, five stars! Highly recomended.  Thank you.",
        "It's the best game I have ever played..... Nothing is locked except a few....... And you can mostly buy things..... There are different shops like one for parties one for free style one for gowns..... There are two or three makeup shops there is a hair salon a jewellery shop..... I think every one should try this game at least for once.......and this is the best game of the coco games so I think try it for once......",
        "Its an suberp game and i like to play it but one thing should be improved that whenever there is a sale the time limit of it should be increased the reason is that maybe some one will be playing the contest and the sale advertise will come but they cant go and when they come to that store the sale is finished. but its really nice game and girls would love it but they show so much ads.this should be improved.rest its a lovely game and organizations of the game are awesome",
        "It was pretty awesome.. Cocoplay I just love ur games but I've one problem, that good dresses r ALWAYS unlocked or maybe 3/4 of good dresses r unlocked. All right I accept it's no big deal but ADDS!! They drive me crazy, siriusly(I really mean it to be \"sirius\"ly) it does. Pls remove so many adds. I m really tired. I m writting a long review so that you can understand more, n help me out.N I hope you do fix it soon. Thank u very much, n hope you keep making brilliant games like this!!",
        "Great game! I think it's stupid that everyone is pitching fits because of ads. It takes time and money to develop these games so either buy it or quit bitching. But overall I enjoy the game, I find it relaxing and it allows for unlimited creativity. I would like more clothes, accessories  and make up added. One fun thing to add to the game would be hats. Thanks.",
        "There is one problem  problem one make everything free cause I can pick anything when I don't have enough money OK OK!   And also liked this game!  But just what I said make all the items free!"

        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "Money sucking game!  You can only play once a day for about 5 mins. without making purchases. I dumped 50.00 into this for extra rubies and it only provided a couple hrs of play. Fun, but it's a rip off and no way to play more than a few mins each day. Bad design, not enough incentives to get good game play...just a $$ pit here.",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping."

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "Game runs like a clunker. There is no smooth transition from one screen to the next or even when trying to click on the people who need a ride. There are FAAAARRRR too many cutscreens for all the various cabbies to hire. It gets tedious after a few minutes. I played the game for no more than 10 minutes and am already tired of it all. I was hoping for better."

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "I really love this game. It's simple and easy to understand, but challenging at the same time. The only thing it's missing is that you can't make any vehicle selections in WiFi multiplayer. If that was added then I would definitely give it 5 stars.",
        "This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it's so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can't find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don't have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!",
        "The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There's also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what's happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution."

        "The game is awesome but not a lot of mini games to play and the sticker collection is small, if you can add more of these it would rate it 5 stars",
        "It's a nice game and cute character it's similar to talking Angela but I think it's better bc items are not expensive like in talking Angela ...the only prbm is the make-up section idk if it's closed or  it's reachable at a certain level.",

Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "This game is designed to make you pay to progress. On levels where you have to serve x # of customers, they are slow to come put so you fail without buying extra time. On levels where the goal is earning a certain amount of money, a large # of customers come out who only want drinks, so you fail unless you buy more time. It's always just 1 or 2 customers short or just 1 or 2 $ short. It's frustrating and aggravating.",
        "Upgrade are hard to get.Spoons rewarding system is very mean. You get 1 to 5 spoons, often it's 1 spoon. The proportion of the rewards is just not right. If you lose the game, you also lose all the gains during the game n start all over again. Frustrating at time. This game depending you to make in game purchase to move on.....",

        "This game is fun and entertaining and you can test drive all the vehicles which make it quite cool. Wish there was a camera view which you could zoom out so you can see from a better angle of all those around you. Reversing auto changes the camera. Some times multiple simultaneous button clicks don't work. And I wish they had one of my favourite cars here, the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento",
        "I'm loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don't change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can't go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all",
        "This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.",
        "Kept telling me that I was going the wrong way even though I was going the right way while racing. Which then it puts you in last place. So, I'm uninstalling this game because it's frustrating to be winning a race and a design flaw ruins the game for me. Also, giving more camera angles would be nice for the other players not uninstalling this game like I am right now☠☠☠☠",
        "Awsome game but please fix the cars that have lower suspension,  for some reason they bug out and start  destroying  it self when you ride walls or small bumps  in tracks. And one more thing add a mode were you can be a cop and take down the racers or cops chase you in races. But in ovel all grat game.",
        "Its a very addictive and also a great time killer would like to see a spoiler selection for the cars. My favirote car is fury. I would like to see a (1963 Ferrari 250 gto WITHOUT smoke stacks) the thing i dont like about the game it is not letting me into the city i bought it and i tried over and over again but its not letting me its gliching a lot and exits me out of the game other than that it is a great game would like to see some new buses and trailers for  the semi's out in test trive mode and a new land area in the mountains."

My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing.",
        "This is completely addicting in a way I've never felt before! I can still walk away from it but the concepts seem so simple yet provide enough challenge to make me think of it even when I'm not playing! It's delightful to say the least!"

        "you need more choices for style like maybe theres  should be clothes lvls too and maybe more hair coloring the colors that you picked are kinda un useful you need more hats  too  the three hats hats are kinda ugly an dwere trying to make it pretty so maybe a funny section of hats and a modern section of hats and necklaces they need more like maybe you could costumize one for your character     and maybe you could choose more charcters  for your desighns i know i know this isnt a quick review but it was just som ideas",

        "It's a good game I just get easily bored with the same thing plus I wish it had a razer so you can make a hair to the side style that would be cool but other wise I liked it",
        "I like game because we are free to create hairstyle in our own way there is no copy mode and i like that i think you should add more colors and some more accesories and hat for a complete look in game and last thing is add new accessories  and colors without deleting old ones they are also needed in game and KEEP YOUR GAME FREE SO WE CAN USE OUR CREATIVITY.",
        "The controls are kinda all over the place , not that many options to choose from, graphics could be more realsitic so sits up like that while getting their hair washed ? 😊"

        "The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT",
        "Entertaining. It's easy to spend a lot of the free money and diamonds on design, then you may have to wait a while to advance if you want to play free. It's clear there is no switch up on the top players, so when you go into competition, it's all about how much money you have to spend. Even when the rooms have a theme, people tend to vote for their taste, vs. if the request stated i.e. Mid-century mod, or traditional. Addictive unfortunately.",
        "I love this game!! \"it helps a lot\" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I'm buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))",
        "I have been playing for a year now and I'm still in love with Design Home! True, it's hard not to spend extra money but I do believe that the makers have formed a game that can be enjoyable by those with money to spend to have fun but, also have developed a game with really beautiful items that one can buy very inexpensively, and even pieces that are in between. You can't get more thoughtful than that!",
        "I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.",
        "Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion."

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",

        "Th is game sucks! It's a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game ever😡😤 Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it's even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "OK I've told Coco Play enough times that I'm Lucy's 8 year old daughter. This game isn't for kids BECAUSE there's a girl that has a really short skirt!!! ITS INAPPROPRIATE!! THAT'S NOT FOR KIDS LIKE ME!!! The controls are VERY hard!!!! Pleaseeeee fix that problem!!"

        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at.",
        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!"

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "You have a great game here.  It's messing up lately?  But Seriously, I've spent many hours playing this super enjoyable game!  Side note.  Do phone game developers understand I only want to spend $5 to $20 per game?  There must be some serious suckers out there.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though",
        "I was disappointed with the \"loot boxes\" that were offered after the most recent update. I bought two and just got resources. I get they're a gamble, but when gems are so expensive to buy, I don't like to waste them. Sad. I hope they respect their player base in the future. Their constant updates are nice, though.",
        "I was skeptical at first, but this is a fun little game.  It passes the time without being overly demanding.   It's easy to play and has kept me interested far longer than most games.  I give it a thumbs up!"

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high"

Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",

Its more a little more calm battle than Pixel Gun because most things happen instanly in Pixel Gun but i have a few problems: If you built alot of things into your map it takes FOREVER to just load it up Next, Some gamemodes like deathmatch and Capture point isn,t popular. Please reply. (Edit:I just realised you never ever replied to someone, I feel like this is useless after all)",

        "Actually the game is really fantastic. The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic. I really loved playing this game but if u add that effect, it will make the game more interesting. I hope u add some more realistic effects in the game. Again I say that I gave it just 1 star to seek your attention, otherwise the game really worths a 5 star........Thank you.",

I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",

It is a strategy game were you have to try and create a deadly virus and wipe out the world, before the scientists find a cure.

        "This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",
        "Love love love it solo much, it made to the top ten best games in my head! It has more items but mixing some items don't really make  sense like Domestication and grass makes wheat that is one item that don't make sense otherwise you can cheat from little alchemy 1 so yeah 55 star from me!",
        "For whatever reason, when I play the game offline, and try to play it again later online, it says there is a progress conflict, but the number of elements listed in each version is much lower than listed in my stats... Works fine if I keep playing offline though... Also, for some elements the number of combinations I have left is wrong or rightdown self-contradictory. Please fix!",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.",
        "This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won't let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",

Searching for it in the search bar reveals it doesn't seem to exist. When I try to combine the ingredients to make obsidian, the game basically says, \"yep that's how you make obsidian\" without actually making any."

I guess the experienced players play against the beginners to master their play. Seems like you would be in a pool of players with similar skills  or number of games or rank. Even if I'm close to winning a game, the connection sucks then it starts over.",

Gee, thanks for the 50 coins every 24 hours!",

I was very happy when I found something I could upload...THIS GAME. its free and fun. Enjoy playing this! Thanks for reading.",
        "Well, I don't even know how to start the game. First, they show me the starting video. Then I just have 20 coins and I can't do anything except for changing the 2 people's clothes. I would be thankful for anybody who tells me how to start the game. But I really like the mansion's design.",
        "Okay, I guess I mean there isn't a point to this game. you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. It's not the worst thing I played bit defiantly needs some updates, But it isn't that bad of a game. All I can say is try it, if you like it, good for you!",
        "FOR THOSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY: When you get to the homescreen, go to the bottom right and you'll see a play button, press that and it'll start the fun. For those who hate this, why can't you observe closely first before screaming your complaints? Can't you see the game creator worked hard just in order to entertain you and you repay them with complaints on not knowing how to play?What if you created a game and others complain not knowing how to play? Is that nice?(Not to offend) thank you",
        "Disappointed It was cute but its really boring, you get a timer that goes too fast, meaning you can't get things done in time! You don't have control of them, they tell you what to do next so no free will, its not like the sims for kids"

        "One of the best ARPGs on mobile! My only critique is that it needs more variations in outfits, as well as enabling people that don't pay ridiculous sums of money to access things like wings a little bit easier.",

Background needed decoration and different colors than just yellow. It was also very glitchy and I deleted it in the first 30 seconds of me playing it. Forgot to add about music, it sounded like a mash of tons of people trying to sing and play instruments  and tons of animals making noise.",

If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can't get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game 💖💞",
        "Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn't take up much space.",

        "Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it's not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it"

The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)"

Second make all types of tools available i got to level 10 and needed  sissors but need 500 coins  and its impossible to earn that many so you need to use real money and well frankly thats BS. Also need to work on the accuracy of the tools.  This has potential and a great start  but needs some work. I will be deleting it in hopes someday you will put some more effort  foreward.",

        "I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should've made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.😁😁",
        "My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it's pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers",
        "The game should not start from zero when you lose a chance there should be 3 to 5 lives. It should restart after every loss where it get terminated instead at starting point. Also at the last life lost I must have an option to save and exit or random quit may take  it to zero.",
        "I think this game gets hanged easily.!!And my daughter likes this app. But it needs a little new version!! And as I would like to tell my friends also.!! But, this game needs a little change like, Now you can skip the adds ,than not get hanged easily or like that And etc.!!! ThaNks I think you can do better !!",
        "I played this as a kid, now I'm playing this again as an adult and the DEVELOPER SCREAM NEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME GIGGLE. THANK YOU. U GOT MY 5 STARS",
        "Towards the end it gets boring. One has to start all over from the first scene, every time one dies. There should be an option to start from other worlds as well. It is really annoying. Also the last levels are at times impossible, for eg. in world 6 almost all the vines are slippery and you never know when you'll loose grip on them, causing you to fall and die.  I like the option of watching a video and getting double bananas or the chance to continue. I also like the sounds although spiky plants can be annoying."

        "A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it's nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don't buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.",
        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.",
        "I'm having issues with the speed/timed sessions.  Towards the end, the animation sequence will glitch, resulting in my opponent having time to get off an additional shot, while I'm attempting to reset and draw the bow.  Outside of that, it's an excellent game.",
        "Game would be great if it didn't lag out after 6 games. I've lost more gold in rush due to the game's performance degrading than I can keep track of. Once it starts losing frame rate just quit or you will bleed gold.",
        "Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10's when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i'm ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i've lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly",
        "The friends system is all jacked up...   I share a Facebook, we can't use Google ID to each have our own.. And even existing friends do not show up. Fun game if you don't mind playing alone in a big lonely world of emoji."

        "This game will never run smoothly 😒",
        "good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)",
        "love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D",
        "Very nice graphics, the customizability of the cars are pretty good, definitely one of the best free drift games out there! However, it could need accelerometer steering, as the button control is quite difficult to use for me. Recommended for the graphic fanatics. Drift on! - Jay",
        "It's an okay game. The customization is actually really good and the physics aren't too bad either hit the optimization isn't great and there aren't that amen cars. Would love to see an MX-5 though. For some reason my upgrades don't seem to be applying though."

Uninstalled due to ads. I still like stickman dismounting by viper games better. I just wish they'd come out with new levels, etc. more frequently",
        "Fun to play for maybe 20 minutes, very little motivation to continue playing. Game will become boring before the 15000 points for the first unlockable item is reached. This gets the lowest possible rating because the goal is to make you purchase points. I'd rather just pay for the game and play through, with some gratification every few attempts.",
        "I would say the game money you would need to unlock next level is pretty high! I am dead sure you won't be able to make to next level without purchasing the game money. This is not cool guys! No body likes playing the same level again and again!",
        "I broke the game. Scored over 6 million points on one map. Other than accidentally breaking the game it's stupid fun. It will make your phone very hot though.",
        "Holy fapping poop, Ive NEVER been so hooked on & entertained like how this game hooks me.  Mad props to the devs.   One suggestion:  perhaps add a little bump/nudge button, in case this poor unfortunate stickman gets stuck in a place where getting bumped or nudged just a few inches will help that poor dipshit stickman continue on to finish his objective that level.   Bug/error note:  On Dinosaur jaws, we somehow got blasted out of the confines of the level.  Got an awesome score tho, nearly 700,000.",
        "Game crashed the first three times I tried to open it. Once you get it to work, you watch adds after literally every run. The goals to get extra coins become large time investments almost immediately because of the vast amounts of coins needed to buy vehicles/characters/props to complete said goals. The old version had less stuff but was much funner to play."

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "Removed ads but now during the game, collecting power ups doesn't actually give me a power up where as my rivals do and they all get ahead with their attacks. Needs to be seriously fixed.  Not fixed. Jus getting annoying now",
        "My game crashed like 4 matches in. It just happened once to me, but online gaming that crashes in a game like this can be a real kill joy. Overall I think it's a great game and I enjoy playing. Obviously, we can all do without the crashes.",
        "When I first played this game, I thought it needed optimized, but after clearing out my phone it plays great. It's fun and competitive, but relatively easy if you've played the previous sonic dash games.",
        "It's a Temple run, Subway surfer lookalike but it's online with real people which makes it cooler than them. And the progression system is great so far."

Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",

        "I'm really enjoying this game - it's surprisingly advanced for an app. Plays very smoothly and looks pretty. One annoying thing is I get network connection bugs from time to time flashing up. They don't stop me from playing tho, so meh. Also, the way they match players together is sometimes pretty suss, ships that wipe you out in two seconds flat...or less... just shouldn't be matched with you. But, overall pretty great.",
        "One of the first games where there is a decent balance between paid and free gamers in gameplay. Amazing game. Just touched Level 50 and got rewarded an Aventador for free. Now to continue blowing up ships. Oh yeah great graphics too. A few more maps could help. Also you should be able to invite your friends. And I sold my super-heavy cannons but a fix would be appreciated.",
        "Help! In game issue, I have a \"superheavy cruise cannon\" in my inventory and it looks as though my \"Arbiter\" ship has a special slot for that type of weapon but when I click the slot my cannon is not there! Instead it shows up when I click the slot for regular turrets, any help is appreciated. Username:RoyalStickman, amazing game will put rating back to 5star after",
        "Was loving the game but now ships show that they're dead and yet they can still attack and he can't Target them. Fix this and I'll put it back in 5 stars. Also haven't been getting my daily log in or my league position award. Starting to think the developers don't care",
        "Epic, got a graphic projector pointing at my screen can't see that well, good game needs more event types, more depth,details in looks customisations  and clans. Non combat ships for trade missons two teams two ships A-B either protect your ship or attack the other. Was going buy the captain kit but it evolved to quick? Does it come back",
        "This is an all out fun and enjoyable game that if you like the idea of space battles and ships you can get different equipment for and upgrade aswell as diffrent level ships it is the one for you however it will REALLY help if you buy the starter pack it made all the difference for me. The ONLY problem i have is with loseing alot of exp and money due to adverts wich restart the game after you have 10 kills or shared."

        "Good timekiller. BUT as always... You have to pay up for the cool stuff... If you're going for F2P, you only get the basic stuff... And well it's getting really boring after some time. After some good hours it get's really repetitive... Right know it feels like nobody takes care about rhis game anymore. No more patches, updates, no new stuff. It's a shame. This game has some potential but it's getting wasted here.",
        "Very Relaxing! Just watching the acid mix with water, then the black hole making it disappear is sooo satisfying! Definitely recommended! But the stuff you pay for.. Its kinda dumb. Like, pay for this and this and not satisfied, yeah, just get rid of that. &lt;3",
        "What a wonderful little way to give your boredom a time out. Developer, great job for what I read as a cool way to give back to the world freely! I have wondered if more pictures are an upcoming addition...? Back to my sand box! 😃",
        "I'm kinda unhappy with this game just a little because you have to pay for the premium stuff and ther isn't much to do without it and I don't wanna pay for it, is there a way for me to get it free like downloading more of your games?! I really do like this game but like I said I might not have it that long because there is not much to do on it I need the premium stuff! Thank you for the hard work on this game but it is not enough to satisfy me fully, anyway let me know what's up!...",
        "I LOVED IT IT IS AWESOME I LOVE HOW U CAN MAKE THINGS EXPLODE, but... i dont know why we have to PAY for the AWESOME stuff!! Am not giving 5 stars untill it gets free or at least cheaper! 😎",
        "I absolutely love this game! I especially love the candle wick,  petrol, wax, fire work powder, plant! But the sawdust, methane and pretty much everything is amazing! The no adds is so cool - thank you. And the in app purchase is fine. It is only one dollar, anyway. Even more in app purchases would be fine so long as they wouldn't cost more than like three dollars! This game is worth so much more than $1!!! If you'd add things like humans, wolves, cows, bears, just basically animals! More materials. You shald make it so you can have more and less space as well as backgrounds! Physics like gravity and being able to shake things. Like shaking the camera will shake the things in your space like rotate. Make it like birds and humans build things or something. It would also be cool if you can change the sprouts materials that it spews!  I have no complaints! Please keep updating. I'd seriously pay $30 on the game if you add more materials and life forms and creatures that do there own unique things and interact with each other or something else awesome! Seriously thanks for making one of the best games I've ever played and keep updating please!  Thank you from Aran s. Ziegler, New Zealand, 14"

        "App looks ok and plays ok, only issue I had was that it crashed my Samsung S7 and shut it off. Only fix was to directly delete install folders from my phones directory.  Other than that, it was ok for my little one.",
        "It's not that I dislike the app itself it's just that it seems to not does what it suppose to. Whenever we tried to display picture onto it, it wouldn't appear. Also other issues when trying to color or paint. But thanks for the effort. So I'll rate you 3 stars."

        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?"

        "Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don't work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!",
        "Great game but el porkado is broken I can barley ever get any crates, they are in levels that are literally impossible to complete, fix now also the king pig system is garbage. I accidentally piled up about 100 of each cake and then spent about an hour dragging my finger hundreds of times. Power ups are too rare. There should just be a feed all button or something, can I please improve the king pig system",
        "I don't  understand why people complain about ads and call Rovio money hungry. If may be a \"free\" game but really nothing is completely free. Developers deserve to get paid. It costs to have a game. Free games have ads just like TV. And you don't have to make the in-app purchase. GO buy a game.",
        "I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don't work right and they glitch out. I've been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can't complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed",
        "Very disappointed that I've had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have some of my actual money!",
        "Since the crazy contraptions update, some El porkado levels and some sandbox stages have been unplayable. The flip switchs in El porkado are broken. And the spring coils tend to stretch to far or break very easily. the glue power-up does not glue perfectly anymore. Can you please fix these"

        "Make that we can upgrade weapon to become stronger. Add reward when you have 100% in one Chapter. Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game. Literaly all have similar characteristic +1 and +5 etc. And what is the point to collect other caracters? For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other caracters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all charaters different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",
        "Edit to original review. Another game that gives nothing on return. Skills and weapons take a lifetime to upgrade without spending real cash. If you don't want to spend real cash don't bother downloading this game. Also most reviews for this game are fake. All dated the same day and 5 stars.  (3/10/2018) Good game so far but why all the fake reviews? 1000 reviews all dated 3/10/2018.  Graphics are the best I've seen in any game. The structure of the game is very similar to Kill Shot games by Hothead. Almost like it was made by them under a different name. Weird.",
        "I like shooting games a lot but lots zombie games are stupid this is simple but if you don't buy stuff you can't go further??I just want to play!! It's a good game though, graphics are good, controls are good, so well done!!",
        "As far as action cell phone games go, this is really good. You can't expect all the versatility of a console or pc on your phone (at least not yet) so all things considered, this is a great game. I've been playing for a few weeks and no pop ups or ads so that's a plus. I imagine you'd have to have a capable device though. This would never have ran so smoothly on my old Blu Studio Energy. It plays awesome on my new Samsung S8 plus though",
        "After the recent update cash does not come up at all in the small and big crates. Before the update always atleast 7000 cash used to come up in the small crates. Please don't update.  Very smooth gameplay. Combines RPG shooter and sniper gaming in one game."

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "Maybe it's just my phone, Galaxy S7, but even when i knew what to do i had to tap over and over again to get a response. Seriously, tap the object 10 times and nothing happens then tap it an eleventh time and it reacts. Very frustrating. Spent most of my time just repeatedly tapping the object. Game is a good concept, but really bad controls.",
        "Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I'm at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.",
        "I'm stuck! I must be around level#50 to 70 and the loading process is froze up.  Can't even get to the main menu, two days now. I've liked Challenge 1&2, but, HELP!",
        "Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there's no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level."

        "I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game",
        "Finally! For the the longest time I've been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn't look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you'll have.",
        "This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don't play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don't make us wait foreverrrr!"

I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging",
        "One token per six hours? So you as a content provider only want me to experience three games a day? That is backwards... Do away with the tokens. You will have users clamoring to purchase the DLC if they can play nonstop. This means that you would have zero reason to charge for the premium game. Anyone who has already paid for the premium gets all future DLC for free and the rest of us would be willing to purchase it. This is a great game that could provide substantial income on well placed future DLC and franchise games.",
        "Time and time again a attacking army with 22 troops defeats a defending army of 22 troops and only losses 4 when the defending army is ment to have the upper hand . Also the game is full of cheaters with two profiles in one game so you cant win. Don't waste your money and time this game is dead there are less and less real players left. They dont care about cheaters just money.",
        "The algorithm used to determine rolls / battles is horrible.  After less than 200 games, I have lost over 20k troops, while destroying only 16k.  That amounts to nothing more than a piss poor design.  Unfortunately I paid for this app, so I am stuck with it.   Game definitely isnt worth the price paid.  Don't make the same mistake I made.",
        "This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",
        "Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you're a beginner so you can clearly never win. Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair"

        "I really dislike how limited you are on steering. More than once I've found myself crashing because I had no animal to jump to and I had no room on my phone to steer properly. I would like to see something like a virtual left and right joystick, or a rework so that instead of holding to stay on (which I understand, you are made to HOLD onto the animal), a tap based system would be a good solution I think. Start the game with a start button, tap to let go, tap to lasso. This would enable the player to move their steering finger freely without worry of accidentally letting go of the animal. Just my opinion though. Despite that I really enjoy the game so far",
        "I bought the mission mule, and it gave me nothing. I even got a confirmation email from Google play. I thought it was just because he's a mule, and I am in the savannah, but I still had to watch a video to get missions. So 1 star. Will rate 5 if I get my unlimited missions  EDIT: The team at yodo1 got back to me in 24 hours, and helped me understand what was up with the mission mule.  Amazing game. Everyone I tell about it, gets addicted to it.",
        "I played the game for a while, and it's pretty good. I only have one issue with the game, and that is the turning. I'd prefer a slider for turning insted of turning based off of how much you slid your thumb. If you do implement that make it an option don't take out what's already there. I'll give it a 4/5. I would give it a 4.5/5, but can't.",
        "This game was played by my sister, than I wanted to play it as soon as I saw it, cause of its amazing graphics. Now that I'm playing it, I just had to rate it. But I had to wait but I never ever preset the never show me again because I knew I was going to rate it some day. And I guess that was today. Love you created a of rodeo staped! And the people who play it too!!❤",
        "Great game, good fun. Please move the pay to continue button from where you hold your finger because I hit it every single time I die so I lose all my money. Also the screen doesnt slide fast enough so sometimes you cannot escape rocks.",
        "Love this game It's very Addicting. I don't want to say to much because I'm still trying to figure it out. **update**  I understand how to play it better now. I want you to know I don't really play much In the way of games anymore but a friend showed me this game and now I'm addicted to it. Also wanted to mention that I'm 49 years old so in saying that this game is for the young and old alike."

        "Honestly, the game started out being really fun. As players increased their skill level other players (such as myself) who aren't as skilled simply become \"cannon fodder\". My suggestion is have several skill levels available for those of us who are less than skilled. Additionally, have a respawn area where you not killed before even knowing where you're at.",
        "Definitely pay to win, and expect a huge difference at level 30, when you're placed against all the top level 70s... not that it matters a lot, when you can pay to be maxed with armor and weapon at +40 by level 30, and many are. Other than those points it's a darn fine game, and I've enjoyed many many hours on it... Edit: Game over for me. My best weapon got nerfed to the point of unusable, and with the added \"skills\" menu the game got way more pay to win. Uninstalling after years of fun. Way to ruin it.",
        "New map Tunisia lags, unable to move. After last mention about lag was banned for no reason, they mentioned speed hack (think that having a high speed network is the issue). Nice work I did not brake any rules or used any third party soft. Your latest version laags very much. Fix it, as I had spend money on it.",
        "It is good but still once you are level 30 it is much more harder. The player must play with other players with higher ranks with their weapons maximized. It just frustrates me to be killed by a level 50 player with  Fn2000+35 upgrades running around guns blazing with high level armor. But the game is still good... But a bit less enjoyable.",
        "There are many glitches in the game like wall glitch, players can kill through the wall sometimes.  Out of 10 upgrade points only 2 times upgrade will be successful, what the developers want to acheive with this ??? Give me back my upgrade points, I have spent money in this game and dont want to waste my upgrade points like this. Updated - 3 mar 2018  After reaching lvl 30, i am forced to play with higher level players, They are having upgraded equipments and guns making it impossible to defeat them. Fix this Issue or I have to search for some other online FPS game Updated - 4 Mar 2018 - Finally after no reply from developers i have quit this game as I am now forced to play against higher level players , literally this game is all about money.",
        "Graphics are average, gameplay is good until you reach level 28. Then it's a complete pay-to-play game. No matter how good you are, you will be trampled by amateurs who've spent a couple hundred on upgrades, guns, armor, etc.   After level 30, matchmaking will put you in battle with people 20 to 30 levels higher, it's despicable.  You can't last 2 seconds exchanging fire with someone after level 28, you've no chance unless you spend a ton of cash.  Way too many bugs as well, hackers can get in very easily, shoot you through walls miles away, become invincible, etc.   Overall, until you even it out, it's one of the worst games out there. Completely unfair gameplay.  Customer service is the worst in the app store. No feedback whatsoever. Game rarely loads. Will not update."

        "This is my favorite game on my phone. I only got it for something else on a different game, but it turned out that I loved it. It is a really fun game and the controls and stuff are easy. The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "The game play and concept are awesome but the only thing I dislike is getting paired up with someone who's lvl 90 (I'm only lvl 23). This means I'm matched up with someone with superior skills, balls and agility than I am..... which pretty much means I know I'm gonna lose. I don't mind losing but it kinda sucks when the favor is tilted in the other players favor straight away. I just did a $100.000 game and guess what? My opponent was lvl 90......",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won...",
        "I shoot it perfect and it counts it as 2 points all the time, and when I'm playing for a million dollars my opponent gets two blue balls on fire and I dont even get one!! Makes this game not fun at all, and what happened to multiplayer with your friends? I deleted this game because it simply isn't fair and seems pretty rigged, hope you guys update some of these problems."

        "Very good! I've seen it often on the play store, and I don't know why I haven't downloaded it sooner. Very funny, cartoonish style, cool masks, good, challenging game play, and, most awesome, no pesky energy meters for rounds! It's awesome. You don't need to wait for anything to recharge before you can play again! My only issue is with the sniper controls. It controls well, but can he jerky, making it hard to aim. A tilt-to-aim feature may make this easier. But overall, amazing work!",
        "Don't get me wrong, this game is great, its fun, addictive and all around a 5 star, but I gave it only 1 because even if my internet connection is perfectly stable, I still crash mid-game because of \"connection issues\". And its not only once or twice, I've had days where I am hours upon hours trying to play, but I can't, sometimes I even crash before the game itself has started, so that's why I only gave it 1 star.",
        "This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn't played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. благодаря!",
        "A bit battery draining and overheating issues. High ping can cause for untimely deaths but a very fun game nevertheless. 10 second ads don't count toward the \"speed up\" for opening cases. It just says \"you need to watch the entire video for timer to decrease\". Also, lots of sniper aim-bots recently. Needs proper anticheats.",
        "It's really fun, has some great mechanics that aren't very common among mobile games, and it is simple to play. But there is one problem I have, which takes place as theif. Sometimes, as I am about to duck down behind cover, there is a short time frame where the sniper is able to hit you even though you are behind the cover. This is for the full covers, not the breakable or the half. They can also sometimes hit you when you are at the full covers, which I hate. The only time I get mad when I die in this game is when the sniper is able to shoot me while I am in full cover or within that short time frame."

Can you add multiplayer please  3. Add a few more mini games  4. That the hospital can expand with every level up",

But it  sometimes takes me out and back to my home screen , I think it a good game when I am bord I can play it and the other ones. I think it should use a little work so mines don't lag and take me out of it  after all it is great and fun I love it so much that I wish it will not take me out the game because it makes me sad a lot but I will not delete it because I like it. I will give it 5 Stars but it lags a lot. Wish you a have a fun time playing.",
        "I liked it but the nurse o no! She is so irritating u can't even control the nurse she always stands between u and never moves and the 2 nurse is always in the bathroom And in one time u have so many patients u can't even hold but if u like then ok",
        "Its a really good game but I have a few improvements firstly the first nurse I ever unlocked went straight to the bathroom and won't move so I think she's there for ever secondly nurses don't really do anything they just pretend to do something also its always the person in the same bed can't you have some variety? Finally the person at the door I can't actually get to...? I know this comment must be frustrating I'm trying not to be to pick but I think its for the best :-)",
        "It's nice. I like the scenery and stuff, but when the ambulance comes and the siren goes off, it scares me. Please make the siren calmer! I would give it 5 star, but I took away one from the scary siren."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

(No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Originaly i gave it 5 starts but for some reason video adds dont work, i cant open boxes  nor get cubes and its frustrating,! Also by opening bixes with  gems i unlocked the SAME LEVEL 5 times! How i can i unlock thre same level more than once? Now i ran out of gems and cant unlock anymore levels to play! I urge you to fix this",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

        "This game is great! Though there are things I would change about the new race mode and some things in arcade mode. For example, instead of having to pay a dollar USD to cut the rope tire, why not pay a thousand coins to get rid of it for the next 5 or 10 times it needs to show up, and have us pay the dollar to get rid of it for good. And in arcade, if you accidentally missed your reward,why not have it double the next reward rather then keep the amount the same all the time, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing besides those two things, I love it ^^",
        "The climbing game is the only thing I hate, it's such BS. My knife will slide and hit a branch after it went into the wood. That's not supposed to happen. But overall great game.",
        "Not perfect but it's really good, hate the tires though, not willing to pay any amount of money to remove them. It would be better if after 1-5 thousand score on race, the tire would be removed or maybe throw a knife 10 times through the tire and it would be gone. Kinda silly to pay to  remove something that would make for much better gameplay if the player could play the game and earn it gone. (Mostly doing this for the 500 coins but this is an honest review)",
        "Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I'd change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful 'flipability', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.",
        "Its a good game. It can be frustrating though at times when the knife lands perfect but it doesnt count it. And at times the flip and fall are not accurate. But overall i really good game",
        "You can thank Rusty Cage on YouTube. Also it shuts off ever few minutes and I don't know why"

But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames",

Eine App, die mit dem Kind wächst und an der das Kind wachsen kann – ohne  Werbung oder Inhalte, die Vorschulkindern Angst machen oder sie überfordern.Die KiKANiNCHEN-App ist ein Angebot für App-Einsteiger, das sich an dem Entwicklungsstand und den Bedürfnissen der jungen Medienanfänger orientiert.

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",

I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won't be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.",

I'm pretty sure it didn't load like that before but over all, 5 stars! Have a good day/Night!",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!"

        "Pay to win: In all my years of gaming, i have never played a game more pay to win than this. If your opponent has bought the tower packs and plays carefully, there is literally nothing you can do with your tier 1 and 2 towers. The only viable strategy is to buy lots of 2:2 wizards and hope your opponent messes up, if your game is as imbalanced as this unless you pay, don't make it free to play in the first place",
        "The only thing I do not like is how you need the vip membership to use the special modes, which I get you guys need money to keep it going but I think like one day a week there it should he free for that day or and hour or two. Keep up the good work Ninja Kiwi 😊",
        "So the ads 30-60 secs, a very small x in the corner to close the ad when finished, in-app purchases, optional ads for extras, bad servers which disconnect frequently...  All suggesting that you pocket a lot of the money without reinvesting in the game, it's a shame since I love TD games but the ads are too much on this and it shows that you're trying almost everything to sap money out of people which takes the fun out too. Uninstalling until the ads are significantly reduced in time.",
        "You have hackers playing this game. I just played a game against a guy who ballons kept passing all his towers but no points came out of his health. I rember why I delted this game in first place. I could have a ton of gallons go thru people's line and they not lose health.",
        "Only fast when showing an ads 😤 and frequently unsynchronized. It made me confused because sometimes the ballon pass trough but the enemy's health bar are not decrease. And when watch the replay. Enemy has tower that not showed in real game.",
        "I have an idea people. If you face people who are not losing a single life, have infinite money, or automatically beat you, then report them. They then can only face hackers like them. And also, I love the game. I mean, those bloons popping are soooooooo satisfying! And you should ban the hacks that are online like infinite medallions, money, or lives. Basically,  I would give this a 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10."

        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "Great way to spend down time at work or at home. Really enjoy playing as characters from both light and dark side teaming up and defeating others. It does take awhile to get charcters leveled up. However can spend some money if you don't want to grind. However I find it rewarding grinding each day to get what i want."

        "The storyline is a great idea, but unfortunately the execution iof this game is rubbish. Despite the lengthy and slow \"click the cloud\" interactions with in-game characters, instructions are so minimal that you get very bored with working out what you are supposed to do.  Graphics aren't really impressive, and although it is perfectly easy to understand how to move your character around the screen, doing so in these ways is a pain. I really wanted to like this game, but frankly it feels a bit like playing something a couple of decades older.",

        "I've been gaming on my cell for 10 yrs now and in all that time there's been maybe 5 games total that I've played for yrs, continuously, and will always play. This is the newest to that short list! I'm not a skier, although I had a ton of friends who've skied their whole lives. This is what I would think it's like. Total rush! Wow! It's an adrenaline I've gotten from no other game. But super peaceful and calming @ the same time! Here's to hoping the Developers are just scratching the surface wth this amazing game! But if this is it? Kudos to you guy's on a job well done!",
        "I am SO happy that this game is back!!! I loved SC:15 and 16 and was so depressed when it disappeared! Now it is back and as great as ever!!! Realistic gameplay, lots of options and courses! Probably my favorite Android game EVER!!",
        "i dont like it ... the vancover 2006 on pc is the best ... stupid androids  ... if you dont know to make a good controller or you have no time for it let some one else to do it ... good graphic .. but controlls and next flag i don know where is it .. i wish fix the cam a little more up to see where to go ... ... fix cam please ...",
        "Cannot play this game, all I can do is type my name in and choose some equipment. Then one is captured in a circle back to type a name etc. What a pity it looks so promising first.",
        "How can you rate a game you can't even play. All I get to do is update name. Nothing else works.",
        "Now this game is very good it's a 10+ Fun and hard best skiing game yet!!"

I would like to be able to buy more things with cash that doesn't involve donuts and when the quests are on you don't leave enough time to finish them. I am on here pretty much every 4 hours all day and I don't think I've fully finished a quest yet. You would practically have to be on here 24/7 to finish them. Other than that...great game!",
        "I can build an infinite amout of kwik e marts so yeah I nuked my town then I placed my kwik e mart that was in my storage then I went to the buildings section and I could build another kwik e mart and I clicked it and It really is real is it a bug or a feature from the sci fi update EDIT:I edited this for no reason and originally sent it in 2014 to 2015. So it's a feature cool",
        "Wish you could buy more stuff with cash instead of it all being donuts. All the really old things are still donut orchard and really expensive.  Would rather be able to buy them for Simpson money even if it was a lot as getting a lot of income but have nothing to spend it on",
        "During the last event I was only getting 29 rewards from friends when it clearly said 30. Since the update icon in left corner has stopped working. It would be nice to be able to buy premium items with cash even at a higher price and longer build time. I'm lvl 859 I know I had unlocked all the jobs in Springfield heights. Now it says I need to unlock them again.",
        "This game so stressful. I've already knew how to play this game but all it does is keep showing me how to do something. It's so frustrating there's no free mode till later 😠",
        "Don't know what you have done on the roughens update but my game has not been the same since I can't use the icon in top left for the characters, my IRS radius has gone to zero, the recycling has stopped working, the furniture, mobile,award part of the game has stopped working how it did. Plus their is other things that have seem to have reset. They need sorting as I am a daily player and do enjoy it but these errors are annoying me"

After I was finally able to reach the settings, I tried to LOG IN EXISTING ACCOUNT and it said that I need to become &gt;&gt; LEVEL 8 &lt;&lt; to unlock this feature. I could never imagine a game doing that. This is absolutely insane. Reach level 8 to a new account in order to log in to my old existing account. And why do I have to play with a new account in the first place? Why not the usual log in screen that every game has!!!",
        "The game is fine but people leave the game in between match or before match.  Its irritating  coz we lose without any reason.  The punishment  for this behavior  is so less.  Just 5 credit points.  Which is just too dumb.  The developers should punish them more or else its too frustrating  and people  will quit and choose other games similar to this",
        "I would give 5 star but now i only give 1 start because today i just format my handphone when i install back my mobile legend and play all the tutorials, it tell me need to reach level 8 then can connect back my account!! If i got a account, why should i waste a lot of time to leveling?? Please ASAP to fix the problem",
        "lag lag lag.. fix lag problem.. other game rarely lag at important time yet this game multiple time.. even so all the fans ml still love this game... just lag will make stress and not fun to play.. i pay a lot of money to play fine skin and hero but its all no fun anymore due to lag non stop .. well sure the latest phone can play without problem.. but what about the low one.. cant even move properly making the player like suicide and more afk..",
        "The game is good, but for the linking account part is ridiculous. I don't understand why must be level 8 then can logon to existing account. It is wasting our precious time just to play so many useless matches until level 8 to change back to your exiating account. Please i would you suggest to change your system of changing of existing account. Thanks",
        "Why after every time u update the app I keep stuck at loading page and unable to enter the game ? I have to uninstall and play until reach lvl 8 only I can link back to my account. Pls don't waste my time. Fix this problem pls."

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Game is awesome. There is a perfect race on season 7 where you need to save 8 seconds. Think there's a glitch as I've done it 6 times and it doesn't count 2nd and 3rd lap sometimes. Please fix this it's my only star Left!",
        "I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "I thought this was a fun game with a good objective.  The fact that you chase someone, throw bottles at them while chasing them, and kicking balls at them while chasing them is quite fun. With so many games out there that have weak game play, this game was breath of fresh air.  The graphics are okay, and the gameplay is easy to learn with good tutorial on how to play. The only thing that I would have them change is the music, it's kinda low even when you adjust the volume. Other then that, I recommend this game to any and everybody. The degree of difficulty is not too easy, or not too hard, but just right and I don't even write reviews but I felt compelled and was really impressed with this game",
        "This is one of the best games, i had ever tested, i also called it an amazing game because it's very easy to get, also not only i but millions of people all over the world considered it to be the best. Ever since i came across this game, i rarely play any of it's related game because this game has shot down the strength of it's other related games and has really offered me the 100% utmost joy and  satisfactions required from it.  This game has an awesome features like beautiful background, images, and soon that could not be seen in any of it's related games, also any slightest click on it derives someone's attention to see the end of it, i also called it a powerful magical game because it can easily cheer someone up,  seeing myself running after the theif made it more interesting and making an effort to win puts an uncontrollable smile on my face. The more i play this game, the More i feel like talking about it because it's really fun to play, and my conclusion is \"this game is recommended for everyone including kids just give it a try you will testify like i did is all i will say to my fellow app users and other people out there\".",

        "I don't like you can't make the buildings the color you want to because you have to change them to level up. Leveling up takes forever if your not willing to spend a lot of actual money. My horses stay needing the infirmary so they are always busy which means they are not available to complete guest wishes, or for breeding, or training. It cost a ton to add spots in the buildings for supplies or to be able to have more than one horse in a building at once. Wish it didn't cost so much I would have really liked the game. Will be deleting this app",
        "I like the game except the fact that things are very expensive and you don't get a lot of money from customers. Plus I have to level up a horse to fulfill a board request but then can't put that horse in any of my buildings because they are a lower level...this is an issue with guests too. I go to upgrade to the next level (4) but when I click the color I need it doesn't give me the amount of fix up points it claims (ex: +75 for lavender but it only foes up +5 on the meter). And half my guests want items I can't give them because I am nowhere near the amount of money required to purchase the building.  I think upsets needs to reformat the pricing of items within the game or up the amount given by guests. Because eventually I may find myself at a point I can no longer continue as I will not spend actual money.",
        "The game starts off being a great game but then becomes a huge cash grab once they think the have you hooked.  Too bad cause this has the potential to be a top contending game if they would just ease up on the cost of some items.",
        "I was lovong this game until it forced you to level your buildings in order to use them when you're trying to save money. They also force you to get rid of your horses after they have so many birthdays unless you have enough rubies to keep them. I put a lot of time into trying to level them up only to have to get rid of them!!! This game sucks!!!!",
        "I loved it, until I got an error 3 message and can't even play now it says to reload the game, lost all. Shame too because I enjoyed it.",
        "I really like this game. TIME KILLER. I have horses of my own and the tasks are totally relative. Keep up the good work."
