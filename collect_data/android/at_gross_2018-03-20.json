        "I don't like you can't make the buildings the color you want to because you have to change them to level up. Leveling up takes forever if your not willing to spend a lot of actual money. My horses stay needing the infirmary so they are always busy which means they are not available to complete guest wishes, or for breeding, or training. It cost a ton to add spots in the buildings for supplies or to be able to have more than one horse in a building at once. Wish it didn't cost so much I would have really liked the game. Will be deleting this app",
        "The game starts off being a great game but then becomes a huge cash grab once they think the have you hooked.  Too bad cause this has the potential to be a top contending game if they would just ease up on the cost of some items.",
        "I like the game except the fact that things are very expensive and you don't get a lot of money from customers. Plus I have to level up a horse to fulfill a board request but then can't put that horse in any of my buildings because they are a lower level...this is an issue with guests too. I go to upgrade to the next level (4) but when I click the color I need it doesn't give me the amount of fix up points it claims (ex: +75 for lavender but it only foes up +5 on the meter). And half my guests want items I can't give them because I am nowhere near the amount of money required to purchase the building.  I think upsets needs to reformat the pricing of items within the game or up the amount given by guests. Because eventually I may find myself at a point I can no longer continue as I will not spend actual money.",
        "Really love this game. However it could be so much better. The ruby system is awful and the cash you get from guests is not enough.",
        "I loved it, until I got an error 3 message and can't even play now it says to reload the game, lost all. Shame too because I enjoyed it.",
        "I really like this game it is so much fun to play.  thank you Guy's so very much.I am a very happy person because you guy's mad this horse farm game again thank you guy's I am having so much fun with this game.i love this game it keeps me so so so very busy again thank you guy's.can you nice people please make some great games like this one.thank you Guy's for making this game.thank you guy's I like it .this is a very very very fun game to play."

It's a good game for me.  I can give it 4⭐, an increase from previous rating.  8/13/17 Just about 2 years later from last rating. I'm still playing.  10/11/17: I continue to play this game with the added annoyance of the interactive advertisement.

I only needed 3 and made a 5 move play and I lost again. This is about the 10th time I've lost due to this game cheating. I haven't deleted yet because I like it but if it cheats again I'm deleting it like the other games that cheat. Today 2/15/18 the game is still cheating. I watched 3 vids and it said I didn't watch until the end. Ugh this game is fun but I'm ready to say forget itttttttt bc I keep complaining and new issues keep arising and they aren't even responding."

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",

When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

Idk but maybe make it so it allows over lay of keyboards? Or whatever coding nightmare that might bring...just figured I'd mention it"

        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics",
        "What is the problem with this app? In one of your levels you say that I have to hit a goal in 6 kicks or fewer and I have to assist with my hero,when I try doing it, you just make angles that make me pass in the opposite direction and my hero is in the defence and after 1 pass my hero just remains in the defence and that's  why I do not have enough stars to unlock the next season and there are a lot of problems in the other levels also.Please improve it or give me a free season unlock or give me some free stars for every season"

        "Top tier player here, I've been enjoying the game greatly for the most part. My biggest issue would be that energy takes years to recharge. If it was shortened to one or two minutes to Regen one energy then that would be amazing. Another issue I have is that I think all players should receive one SSR when they complete the tutorial. I have a whole team of them, but others aren't so fortunate. Thanks for your time, if one or both of these are changed I will rate this 5 stars!",
        "In short, games got amazing potential. Amazing manga-like visuals? First I've seen for an app. However, they NEED to make the d*$&m game more F2P so the player base is more welcoming, how TF is it you can ONLY get Pandora at VIP 8?!..   Also, many-many other great games do offer lifetime gem login purchases.   Just saying. ;)",
        "Nice. They added new characters. I'm waiting for Namida, Brandi and Sora's SSR forms, hope they come soon. There's one problem I'm having with the recent update though. I can't play Soul Towers Battle in Special Trials because my phone keeps crashing. The gameplay in other areas are running smooth, only the Soul Towers Battle causes my phone to crash. Fix it please...",
        "I really loved the gameplay and the characters, but then all of my dadta got lost and i had to start from the begining. I made it so far within the story and leveld up my characters so much. Grinded for a few hours to get the materials and money i needed. It was all for nothing. Fix this bug pls. Hope this doesnt happen to your account",
        "Not so much a review, but I can't figure out how to unlock the last two outfits.(Gal.cat and the blue yakata). Any help much appreciated. Cannot find guides anywhere. Is this game p2w? Somewhat but you can unlock everything without paying.",
        "It's just a pay to win game. I'm very disappointed for the energy bar... I need 13 hours and 36 minutes to recharge to full at this point. Difficult to upgrade characters and their skills and everything you want to do you must pay. As a game (idea) awesome but unplayable if you can't afford it"

        "The developers do not contact you with game issues in any timely manner, you spend months playing for the game to randomly unshield your base before the time has even expired causeing losses when there shouldnt be any. And support like i said is terrible do not waste your time or money downloading this! You will only be disappointed in the end.",
        "After playing for 10 months straight every day, still come back, even though everything is done very slow by that advanced level of the base, therefore it's addictive. A sci-fi setting in a familiar and loved universe helps, of course.  Just need to be able to send to other players various items, boosts, and shields, not only resources, that would make it much more interesting at this point!",
        "I would rate the game higher but it needs major work. The wait times for smaller troop tiers and beginning research is horrible. Makes the game boring.  I am waiting to see if I continue to play it. Depends if anything changes. To research for tier 2 infantry takes over a day. At this current time this is a very pay to play game as you would want speedups. This is odd for Plarium. I enjoy their other games. This one needs vast improvement and fast if they want to keep people around. As well the game is in desperate need of an in game translator!!!",
        "I really love this game. Easy controls. Yes, it takes a little longer to upgrade various parts of the base as you level up. I encountered the first war. WOW!But, One thing, please tell to upgrade this Draedulus-12 leader. He is at level 23, 3%. He still look the same. OVERALL-AWESOME.!!!",
        "I loved this game initially but one massive problem I have experience is the chat box within your leagues forum. It is massively glitched and when you type or try to delete one word then ten new ones randomly come on screen. This makes chatting to your team mates almost impossible. I asked plarium many times to fix this but they keep ignoring. You want a game where you can chat with ease with your team mates",
        "I m playing this game for long time and i liked this game but now this game asking too much .So many back to back events .I think the game maker must know that all playing this game have a real life to deal with.Reduce back to back events.I m sure if u guys dont do it most players will quit and this game will be longer played."

Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",

Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",

I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",

Please fix those problems",

I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this."

        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

        "Great game for a short while unless you have money to dump in it. Once you get to your 7th or 8th car, the prices sky rocket. Oh and the last car? Will take you weeks to make enough money to purchase because the online races are RARELY fair. I often am matched with the class above my car who has nearly as many mechanical points into it. Doesn't make sense, losing streaks of 10 or more happens frequently. Good luck if you want a fun and rewarding FREE experience. No luck needed if you dump money into it and a lot of money, their p2p packages very expensive.",
        "Fun racing game.  Good time waster, as with most games like this, you can NEVER upgrade your cars enough.  Free crates don't drop parts needed enough, Elite crates take way to many tokens.  And there again the chance of getting great parts or Free cars are NOT going to drop for you.  And the Tuning is very complicated.  And way to many online cheaters, that you can hardly beat.",
        "Everything is awsome about it besides one thing   That ome this is when your storage is full and you get a surprise part from racing it only gives you two options to discard it or to buy a new slot. what would really be helpfull is if you could trade a part for it and instead of having to discard it",
        "Awesome Game! A bits a bit hard to level up and lock the super cars though. Also cars are very expensive. Wish there was SUVS and pickups as well! Other than that great game easy controls and all",
        "If you don't plan on spending money don't even both. It cost me $20 just to get out of the first level. Then you win all these prizes but can only collect them if you spend real money on there gold. $$$ so sad because it is a fun game."

        "Great gameIncredible game. But when you move up in lvls the cost of every detail is ludacris! I've played this game a month and spent good money on it.  I am not into waiting a half a day so I can gain a 5 min advantage, then turn around and do it again. Only this time, just wait longer! .... Or of course you could just spend be re $.... Awesome game... makers are greedy!",
        "I'm not happy that I can only send 20 gold from my accounts to one of my accounts per day. I'd like to send more gold per day. Annoying 2 alliance war battle limit should be gotten rid of. It's annoying, expensive and takes a very long time to reach each level of the game. Overall, it's a good game to play but it can be improved",
        "The last few days this game become completely useless and unplayable. The matchmaking has been tweaked to the point where I'm being attacked by significantly higher players, without even a possibility to retaliate! At the same time when I try to attack in quick match, the level of my opponents is being so high, that I have zero chances winning a simple attack.  I'm thinking about uninstalling this game permanently. When contacted, Zynga employee suggests to spend more money to upgrade my defenses. How is that for \"humanly friendly\" customer service? Horrible service.",
        "After getting to HQ level 10 it just got so boring.  To be honest don't like the game play playing against other people either.  The play is slanted toward the attacker .  Deleted",
        "It's quite unreasonable that the nuke is too close to other command items! So, please give me back a nuke, and 40000 fuels as well as 5000 metals for reviving robot and retraining tanks! Also put the nuke to other corners!",
        "Game has a fun, friendly community of players. Load times kinda slow. Occational bugs and glitches. Usually following after updates. Overall though a fun game that has new features added frequently, keeping it interesting."

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

        "It's a good bingo game with a good amount of variety. Love the fact that you can play in different rooms and get bonuses with the puzzles! I was wondering if buying the elite pack is a one time purchase or a monthly fee. Couldn't find the answer anywhere. One tip to make it even better would be to make the tickets a little easier to get. Otherwise would give 5 stars!",
        "My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "The game itself is very fun.  However, if you run out of tickets, it is way too difficult to earn more.  Apparently, they made it easier to earn tickets but after playing many other games, the update isn't enough.  To continue playing, you must buy tickets.  I may have to delete the game which is a shame because it really is a fun game.    3/18/18... They tell you to play lower cost games to get more rewards but it doesn't.  It just takes you a bit longer to go through your tickets but you don't win anything.  Time to delete.  Graphics were great and games were fun but without tickets you can't play.",
        "Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well."

        "Das sind manchmal voll leichte Rätsel, manchmal voll schwere! Das find ich ne gute Abwechslung! Die bei vielen erwähnte Werbung kommt bei mir nicht sehr oft! Also ist es super! Voll cool! 😎 👍 Cool! Cool! Cool! Cool!!!!!!!!!!!! Danke des Spiel ist super!",
        "Hatte beim Ligaspiel gerade folgende Situation: Die Runde war zuende und mein Gegner und ich hatten beide 2 Punkte, also unentschieden. Also wurde die Zeit gemessen, um zu gucken, wer schneller war. Auch bei den Punkten, die wir nicht hatten. Warum? Und wieso kann ich über 100 Sekunden gebraucht haben, wenn ich nur ca. 30 Sekunden Zeit habe? Wo ist der Sinn?",
        "Funktioniert, ist aber katastrophal nervig aufgezogen. Es gibt viele gute Alternativen - im Rahmen von Rätselspielen - sofern man des Englischen mächtig ist. Mir hat diese App sogar Deutsch aufgezwungen, der Rest meines Handys inklusive des Betriebssystems ist auf Englisch",
        "This game is quite difficult when you don't speak more than maybe 5 words of German....",

The game is challenging but that is the fun. I played the same game on my smartphone and my tablet and I have been able to conquer all the islands on both. How about another island? When is a new island coming? I scored over 6,000,000 points on the King's castle to end the game. Get a new island, please.",
        "The only problem I have with this game is the need to rely on friends to help you if you run out of money to pay your ransome.  Because if like me you have no friends who play the same games.. This is a problem that needs to thought out or find another way for the player to hook up with other players.",

And I have a pic saved of my pocket pair.   Last time I checked it is impossible to be dealt two of the same card.   And in what world does a three of a kind lose to two pair.   Will never spend money on this app again!!!!!!!    So glad to receive a generic response...   It would have been nice if you actually read the review.  It doesn't matter how lucky you are. You cannot get get 2 of the exact same card dealt in the same hand.  And no matter how lucky you are 3 of a kind shouldn't be losing to two pair.  That just the rules of poker.",

        "Pretty cool Bingo. It would be nice if more scratchers were available to collect puzzle pieces so you can collect more prizes. Even though you can still win cherries after you completed the scratcher, it seems kind of pointless. My suggestion would be either add more scratchers or remove it once all of the cherry prizes have been collected.",
        "When I first started playing over 6 months ago everything was great. It is the best bingo game on Google Play and I have tried every one of them. but the last 78 bingo games I have played, I have not got one Bingo and I barely get any of the numbers it calls. The last 10 numbers it called on one of them, I didn't even get one of the numbers. Everything started going south when I started spending money. If you download this game, do not spend money. If you do, it will not give you any bingos so you will keep spending money. Like every other game, it's a money grabber😔 but unfortunately this one is worse than most 😠 Thanks Bingo Pop!",
        "By far, the best bingo app on the market.  There aren't any false numbers or bingo daubs . It also gives you a chance to  earn the cherries instead of paying for them.   They've mixed in ads to the game so it doesn't feel like you're watching commercials between every game.",
        "I didnt think you could make a game suck any more than it already did but you guys did it the game sucked before now it sucks even more you guys need to fire the person that updates your game he or she has never played a game of real bingo because this game is nothing like real bingo",
        "Out of cherries in less than an hour. Wins are not enough to keep playing. Odd that they would even have a high roller room. Guess you gotta purchase the cherries. FAIL",
        "Wouldn't even let me play. Kept saying I was too young to play even though it didn't give me an option to enter my age"

Edit- ok I'm in again, but I'm still mad, but relieved I didn't throw away my money. OTHER games send a apology message than an update is being performed or something. But as a game it is fun & strategic",
        "Would have given 4 stars if it didn't make you wait 4hrs on the pvp award or at least make the 4 he wait start when you first make the 1-5 match. Not wait 4 hrs after you complete 5-5. Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",
        "It's needed bug fixes for HTC One M8 since release. Current event RoboBebe stuck at applying configs. Matches work fine over my work hotel wifi but home wifi must reconnect after every match pvp or solo. 5* is my opinion regardless just 1* to try and catch devs attention",
        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

Units that can't be destroyed, app hangs and crashes, poor object collision detection and many coop games dropped.

Followed the troubleshooting instructions but still same issue 🙁. I would appreciate any help please."

        "Fun & Addicting. I love and enjoy this game & still play it. It has a plethora of dinosaurs/Prehistoric animals to obtain and level up. Unfortunately, this game no longer receives updates, at least not to my knowledge. Which I expected after Jurassic World came out, Is expected such. But it's still disappointing, it'd be nice to see a new update from time to time. I would love to see new dinos come to the game.  The graphics are great for a mobile/Facebook game. And the combat mechanics are fun, it would've been nice to see the battle arena introduce an Aquatic & Glacieral arena too. But I would 100% recommend this game, personally I enjoy it not than the Jurassic World version",
        "My son loves this game, he prefers it to the jurassic world game. But the last few days it just comes up and says it can't connect to the Internet,  which is weird due to a) the tablet is connected to the Internet,  b) the signal bar for the Internet connection is max bars and c) we have a 200 meg connection. Plus it's only been the last few days it was running fine before hand. Has there been a recent update? Gunna reinstall it and see if that works as it fixed the last issue he has.",
        "Honestly, this game is great. Like we live on real jurassic park. I dont want to comment about tournament, money n so on, but i want to focus why every time i open, we have to download the content every time? new update? i dont think so. first we need to download 134mb follow by marine park n another park i forget what name, both 80mb n tournament 248mb. what the hell. in a week, i can count number i download the content every time. just wasting my data. i admit this game is best since jurassic park my favorite movie but dont put any annoying thing in this game that make me feel not interested to play. tq",
        "I think it is great and you build and control the whole park and this is the second Jurassic Park because Kelly, Malcolm's Daughter from The Lost World Jurassic Park, gives a little hint that is found when she says \"I don't know why my dad has to worry. This park is much safer than the last one.\" Also I love this game because I love Dinosaurs and Jurassic Park and World. I could just watch a Jurassic Park and World marathon!",
        "I like the basic park building and managing as it reminds me of the old Dino Park Tycoon game. That said it has some of the most aggressive and absurdly expensive micropayments I've seen in a game. Not exactly pay to win, but if you want most of the really valuable animals be prepared to pay or farm special currency.",
        "It's a fun, addictive game but it costs a lot of money to do anything after the first couple of levels. Even evolving the dinosaurs costs waaaaaay too much. It would be better if it weren't so much and I didn't have to spend so many actual bucks on the game. As well as some of the dinosaurs even costing \"bucks\""

Even with the dark matter bonuses and increased infectivity from your bacteria slots it takes too many attacks and nanos. The game desprately needs a way to penetrate shields, or reduce shield strength.",

        "How does one get the achievement No Time To Lose?  And, please fix the scrolling.  Whenever I scroll any list, it snaps back again. EDIT: The best I've seen of its kind.",
        "The game is a decent enough time waster. However, when you begin getting into higher numbers the game breaks. I have over 100x the required about of bacteria to destroy a planet but it still says i can only take out 99.48%.  I have currently 75.528 oo bacteria and the planet Esloytis says it requires 47.310 nn bacteria to complete, but im at 99.7%. The numbers being dealt with are literally astronomical and unfathomable as a human, but following the progression of the game so far it would seem i have fathoms more bacteria than should be required.",
        "I am not really happy with the new update... The colony prices have been increased... Now it would take even more time to collect the amount of bacteria needed to destroy a planet... Please change it back to its old colony costs... Overall, the game is awesome...",
        "Good game, but $3.79 a month to remove ads? Most games have a one time payment to remove ads and it's usually less than that. Only $13 a month for World of Warcraft. There's SLIGHTLY better value for your dollar there."

It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

        "This is a great game! Everything u is free unless you wanna buy more energy. It takes Wi-Fi to play, which is one of the only things I don't like about it. The other is the story line goes a little slow. But after all I love all their story's.",
        "Love the concept. Hate that you have to wait for only 300 energy each day that barely gives you anything. Also, if you've made the wrong choices, you can't watch the secret scene without paying. There should be an alternative to that.",
        "Fantastic gameplay, blushing scenes and beautiful artwork. When I ran into a little issue during the game, customer service was absolutely darling! Their patience and kindness really lighten my mood! Would recommend! ~(^-^~) (~^-^)~",
        "The game is a good one but the lack of game time you are given for free each day means you only get a minute of game play every twenty four hours... As much as I enjoy playing I can see I will get tired of slow progress and eventually delete it.... I know we all need to make money and all but you really don't stand a chance to enjoy these games with such little game time.",
        "I LOVE Drogo, and Ryan! I'm on chapter 5 or 6 of Gabriel and I don't even know the point of the story. It drags on and eats your energy up but literally nothing has happened yet",
        "Dear publisher,  though I enjoyed the game I do think that you should give more energy or at least two times to refill per day. Many people (including me) are impatient. Some might give bad reviews and even delete the game. Your dearly, Nina"

        "Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "I really like this game!  The game feels so real. The text messages you send out and get are from your actual time! Oh to make the game more interesting...you go to the dial tone dial 893702 the erase it don't hit call. At the bottom it will say chat, settings, etc. Click on those then go back to dial tone and repeat. This will give you more \"money\" to buy more lives and stuff. This really helps make the game more interesting! I am currently addicted :)",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for ages, I love the storyline to it and the interaction with the other characters - the only thing to make that better would be if we could submit our own responses rather than the two choices given. The puzzles I like, but it would be interesting to have different types of puzzles rather than the same one repeatedly.  Got to the witness protection part of the game and it has frozen on me. I have collected all stars but no interaction is coming up on the text screen so not sure what to do next!!",
        "I left a negative review at first before uninstalling it. After a few days or so, I deleted the review and decided to give it another chance and installed it again. So glad that I did! Now I love this game. I find it interesting with the storyline as well as the puzzles. It does leave me curious about how I'd react or what I'd say if it was real instead of a game. I was hoping to get it on another device, but this game isn't compatible with it. Thank you for this game! I ended up having to start the game all over again since I had to factory reset my phone, so this is 2 reviews in one. I love this game and it's very addicting to me since I'm addicted to it. Even after I get all the goals completed with the puzzles, I still want to continue. Love the storyline since it keeps my interest. Thank you for creating this game for all of us to continue to play and enjoy.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I absolutely love this game but I had something glitch to where I have all my messages but the block buster game said I've only completed the first set of puzzles when I was actually on probably the sixth or seventh. I tried playing along thinking it has to do with someone hacking my messages in the game but to no avail. I'm considering uninstalling and reinstalling I just don't want to go that far back and have to start over with how slow it is to progress. Please help!"

        "There is an issue that needs to be addressed. My game will kick me out without warning, even in the middle of making a move in-game. This has happened to me several times already and I'm passing thus information on. Please, King Games, investigate this immediately because I enjoy your games and would like to see this resolved. Thank you.",
        "Update: HELP! now I can't do anything whatsoever with other people! I can't ask for lives or send them! It's getting frustrating when I can't even use the lives I've already been given! Why can't I send lives anymore?!  Thank you! For updating the game! I almost uninstalled this game cuz it was taking so long. Hello! Out of levels! Hurry up please! I enjoy the game, but I'm all caught up. I've been trying to up my scores just to have a reason to keep the game on my phone. So far so good. I just started today and I'm enjoying it! Thank you! More recently, I love it! I've been trying to find a game with the quality of King games in this category and no one is a good! Thank you!",
        "Love this game! It's challenging, addictive and beautifully developed both visually and audibly.My complaints would be:   *Certain aspects of the game are not clear, with nowhere to reference. So certain occurrences just seem incidental and therefore don't allow you to fully strategize.   *There are no written rules or explanations to refer to. Additionslly, the game is not customizable. I was just assigned a random avatar (which I don't like) which doesn't appear adjustable.  *It also used my real name to identify in the game, even though I had already created one before registering to King Games. Worse, there seems to be no way to change this either.  If there is a way already developed to address these issues, please help!",
        "I would've rated everything MUCH higher before I did the update. Now I can't play anymore. The words are too faint to see, and the game won't load properly. I LOVE this game, and REALLY want the bugs fixed so that I don't have to quit playing.",
        "The last update was terrible, scores and progress so faint it cant be read, please do something about it, updated again today and it's worse than before can't play the game at all now, going to get rid of it",
        "Very engaging & easy to learn. Bright explosive graphics that are smoothly animated. Great for all ages. Just the right amount of a challenge with levels increasing in difficulty. Practice makes perfect.  Some levels are easy but some are fairly difficult."

        "This new update is stupid. Its been  playing this game for a long time now n everything seemed fine til u guys decided to update it like for what I have no damn idea . It's harder to win now even when u first start the game with Catalina! Then when I do contact you ppl I get a stupid automated email that I can't even reply to. New update includes the first five balls if ur not on the game by the first ball those numbers don't count! Did that n never got refunded my credits! Y make it harder than it already ends up being. This game before had me winning left n right with the first few levels then new update now sucks just playing the first level and you're losing most of ur credits then get to a certain level n u guys want 100 credits for cards that don't have shadow cards half the time n u Kat do not win. Y the update? N just switching cards to check numbers gives me a damn migraine like why did u guys change it for????",

Love going back levels to see if i can get the feather.   Coin packages need to be more attractive if you want people to spend real money and tbe power up packages are way too expensive. Still....... i love the game",
        "Well did love the game not now as it's taken me a long time to get off one level even brought more coins just to get. Only just now finished the last one I mean really come on now. Wat a joke  This why I've given a low rate",

I played this game for hours upon hours and while it saved all my achievements to my Play account, it clearly doesn't backup there because when I had an issue where I had to reset my phone, I lost my entire progress in the game.

        "Awesome! I can play this game to make levels, play levels, friend people, And customize the avatar! Also, you can play the main levels! This game is really fun to play! And the last thing I was gonna say: You get user coins in levels, Secret coins in main levels and stars in main levels and other levels!Also you get orbs and diamonds on new best. And if you complete main levels! This game is so good. You get colors too! Everyone should play this and never delete it. This is one of my favorite games I was ever playing in my whole entire life! I will play this everyday since this game is so amasing and cool. I will play it already like now. And I like 2.1! And I liked 2.0. But when will will 2.2 be here? In 1 year! So let's keep playing until robtop makes 2.2. But I don't need to wait for 2.2! Cause I don't know what will happen in 2.2 but let's see!",
        "I swear this is one of the best games you could ever play it involves timing but the soundtracks are amazing almost infinite user created levels and 22 regular levels to play. Subzero and Meltdown plus geometry dash world all offer free content that is including light but this is 100% worth the price that it is listed for. Even though I'm not like a certified critic I would still recommend this to anyone 5 and up to whatever age",
        "It is awesome, and you should get it.  Geometry Dash Lite, I mean.  The idea itself is not originally theirs, but they dominated it when they used it.  The music is also amazing, and the fact that you can try making your own level is just even better.  Also, if you did not know, it has levels that are not in the free version.  So there you go, my review",
        "This game is awesome!!!!!!! You can make levels, icons, and other cool stuff!! If you were reading this rate description I hope download this game. :) Now im a bit concerned that now every time i get on a online level it freezes. Please fix this and ill give you back 5 stars. Really now when i click on begginer pack on map packs they're hard",
        "RobTop please reply but if you have an account but you can't log in to it and nobody stole it then how are you supposed to get in your account? And the game is the best ever also check out my level it's called china666. IDK why I named it that, the icons are cute just to say. I think everyone in the USA should play this!",
        "2.11... a great update for icons and change. But. I am now missing 19 of each shard and only 18 ice shards for whatever reason. I wish that didnt need to happen but oh well. Also if a level doesn't exist any more you can't delete your comments off of it. Other that that I love this amazing game. #Rubrub"

I see others are having the same problem and all you say is please email us.  Fix your game or I'm moving on here and at the casino.",
        "Its an okay game, the problem is seems like everyday you end up getting around 200000 coins, and you play for about 6 minutes before you need to find another game to waste some time. The min bet is around 8100 and if you want to play a new or \"the machine of the day\" min bet is around 25k. I suppose its realistic considering you rarely win.",

I can't go 2 the Casino often bc I stopped goin 2 the SCAMMING INDIAN CASINOs so it takes 3 hrs 2 drive 2 a REAL honest GAMING COMMISION REGULATED Casino, so this Pacified me until then. But this 2 is a rip off game, the 2hr Bonus Game. If u watch most of the time the timer isn't even moving so 2hrs is more like 4 hrs! Just another company 2 RIP U off, STOP Falling for this!

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",

Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "Just a heads up. Like I said before you people had this planned. Within this year you have proven your desire. Tell me... when have you played a game that changes like a leaf in the wind? I have never seen any Developer change core functions like you have. Wonder why others used to love this game? It's not the graphics! Summoner Wars and Clash of Clans have you beat! Wonder why? They add and not change everything in just a few days like you have. Like I said before...You reap what you have done.",
        "Actually... I was bored and installed this game and I noticed that my gameplay didn't diminished even after the stall was removed. Actually, now that I think about it, I didn't even use the stall that much. I take it back. I am so sorry for the negativity that I showed. I love this game so much. Btw I didn't spend real money on this game lol.",
        "I love this game so much, but there's always a moment when I enter a room that the fade-in heavily lags. I always thought it was just making the area entry take longer, but it's actually gotten me killed upon entering one of the pvp areas, so it's definitely not normal. Nothing I've changed in the system settings has worked, so I really hope I'm not the only one this is happening to. Also, I think the water elemental magic for the Summoner is bugged: I used it several times in the base and main tower, and it hit in wildly different spots depending on whether I was aiming for an enemy or not. With no enemy in your direct line of sight, the spell always hit directly in front of me, but if I tried to attack a monster with it, it hit in a spot much further ahead instead. This is actually a huge problem because it's effectively impossible to aim the spell. I hope these are addressed in future updates.",
        "Only thing I ask is that u make summoner advanced classes I suggest mabey a nechromancer like summons dead can revive friends from death mabey once a day or like three idk mabey make a demon class like a underworld class where all skills are demonic in nature or a animal summoning ability this should have been thought of before class was released btw just saying otherwise amazing game 10/10 in my opinion",

        "Okay, I started this game like a few weeks ago and I am in love with this game! It has great story and the cats designs are fantastic! One tiny problem, the material costs of the main story is hard to get and it would take me ages without buying anything  with real money. Overall I love this game and I really hope there is going to be another competition to add another Castle Cat, it would be amazing to see more people design cats!  This is one of my top recommendations for people who want a cute and awesome game!!!! Keep it up!",
        "Well, I like this game like anyone else. But I have a suggestion-maybe you guys should unlock everyone outfit for the guild leader. I have this very beautiful outfit that is still locked and I just can't stand myself. Anyway, others are perfect but can be better. Nothing else. 😊 ( PS the cats r nice to throw WHEEEE ) #justthatlittleproblemofmine #unlessyouguysagreelikeit #heythegamesniceperfectloveit",
        "It so addicting. I played this for a while and ot os so fun! Thi is a game you shpuld want to play. It os also so cute. The only thing i dont like it that it makes u pay 10,000 dollars for a cat you may not want and u cant get ur money back.",
        "I do LOVE this game but, there a problem... my device can't load up the game anymore. I have no clue why this problem is happening ive looked at caslte cats Q&A and got nothing, i know if uninstall the game that there would be a slight chance of me getting my data back. I really want to start grinding for the easter event, but when ever i click play IT JUST SENDS RIGHT BACK TO THE INTRO! I would had rate this 5 stars insted of 4 but, the reson its 4 stars is because of this issue.",
        "It's a cute game but crashes frequently when I go to collect quest rewards or supplies. This is especially irritating when I've joined the battle or done a redo to reroll for all the quest rewards - I lose everything!",
        "YAY ME! I'M A BETA TESTER! :3 I wanted to see ratings for a long time... and it's 4.9! Probably because of the 'tap-your-tablet' functions. (those are some of the highest rating apps in market) I wanted to rate it since recent Easter Event, when I first got it. I like the quests, storyline, characters, the heroes, and Pugomancer; even though I'm a CAT PERSON! It must be the fact that he's an antagonist; I like antagonists. So, the battle system's cool, but I wish I could just use gems to speed it up sometimes. :) I really wish recourses were cheaper and easier to get. The bugs are: when I watch a video in battle, the thing skips. (like its a video that's buffering) The other issue is that (sometimes) it's kinda hard to move from one end of guild to another. Other than the bugs, great job PocApp Studios! :) Edit: Can you add more mini-games? I'd also like to read past event storylines... :)"

More things to do for random rewards like something that takes an alloted amount of time to do and it costs gold or whatever and uses builders to finish.",
        "So I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 3 due to the fact I noticed that to upgrade the gold mine from lvl5 to 6 it takes 4 hours and from lvl 6-7 it takes a FULL DAY. Other then that pretty fun game. Just some rediculously long wait times on certain things.",
        "Wicked game! Been playing for a while now.  Loads to do! Although the layout seems a little confusing and over the place. But in saying that the game has good graphics, story and characters. My only issues are, the price of things and how long it takes to upgrade things the more you progress through the game amd of course the confusing layout but that's due to so much content.",
        "This is a great game. It's not over complicated and very simple to understand everything. It is much better any other of those clash of clans type of games. The only thing I find difficult is getting the resources to level up skills early on in the game also early on in the game it's really hard to raid when skills cost 3.5 rage when I can level it up to reduce the cost. Other than that this game is very awesome. I rate it 4* all around because \"nothing is perfect\".",
        "This game forces you to buy gems just to progress your hero's. It's too much. They rarely give you anythong in the other options to get what you need for your hero's. Also they only take gems for certain upgrades. This is a joke and shows how greedy these developers are. Not worth a dime.",
        "This game is a complete ripoff. Content is beyond boring. They update the game MAYBE 1 per month. There's bugs that don't get fixed and the only new content you should ever expect to see is content that costs real $. Awful game. Do not waste your time."

        "the graphics are great the controls are perfect.  Im finding there no intense action or planning. Best way i could say is you dont change troops or towers out much because you use the best till something else comes out... there's not much of trying different strategies because you know your using your stongest already. hope that makes sense.",
        "Runs almost smoothly on my Android phone but in some cases when I raid a convoy, my screen auto zooms in and out even though I'm only touching one finger on my screen while in my IPhone it often disconnects me during raid search or in actual raid,hope you can fix this issues. All in all, great game and keep it up devs.",
        "The opponents it gives you are wayyy too freakin hard. Can't beat anyone and it takes 10 minutes to heal your troops after EVERY battle. Can't even play.  Trades take hours.  Boring and frustrating.",
        "I like the game... But upgrading buildins sucks.. takes a lot of time,. Making money sucks towers not strong enough to help you... sorry wish I could give you a 5 star... Good game though",
        "Since you hit headquarters LVL 5 game became unplayable without spending money. You will loose literary every fight. Everything becomes so expensive that it takes days to upgrade something.",
        "Ambush is based on trophies but it should be based on HQ lvl. If anyone has 1000 trophies the high lvl HQ players can attack him which is not right. Also no report option in chat as i can see people cusses a lot and misbehieve a lot on chat. For developers.... lazy as they do not respond to any query. If you are rearranging your convey then still people can attack you while rearranging. I have spent good money on this game so deserves a responce from lazy developers. So from my side only 1 star."

        "Two things which needs to be corrected. If the game is played in silent mode then ads should also be silent. Second, it is not possible to check the meaning of the last word because the level ends as soon as you discover the last word."

There are so many pay-walls and over-powered opponents that you have to pay to beat, it's just not worth playing anymore.",

        "MONEY HUNGRY! Play only if you intend to pay. Only got to the 4th it 5th puzzle and the only way I could continue was to pay! Don't misunderstand, this is a very good game. But unless you're willing to pay you have to wait for quite a while to get to play again. All of the Criminal Case games are the same way. Never been so blown away by a game insisting on paying money like this before. Very disappointed!",
        "Great gameplay. Colorful and vivid graphics. Smooth gameplay on LG Aristo 2. Been playing this a long time, took a break and came back. Why am I seeing Ads every minute in the game now ?!?!? I've never had that issue before at all. Now its Ads every minute !!",
        "Getting less fun than ever.  Pop up adverts in game very irritating.  Reported glitches in game to get response to follow self help which i already did.  Constantly bombarded by attempts to get you to spend money.     Used to be a great game by now would not recommend.  Will stop when i complete in 6 levels",
        "this game is so addicting. the only thing I hate is that they don't reward energy anymore. No drinks etc. I just wish you didn't have to buy energy to continue . otherwise I love this game. it's a great time consumer when you are borwd",
        "I played this game for a VERY long time. Recently, the creators have made lousy changes, making it difficult to get energy to play and giving us adults some stupid, useless stickers. Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

        "I truly love this game i have been playin it since a year ago now and it is definitely a heart taker it is a \"masterpiece tht is missing a signiture\" i believe tht u guys gave a 100%. But i am looking for a game with 110%... Basically it should include more car customizing options like rims, spoiler, hoods, etc. and i would like to see being able to sell ur cars for decent profit in the game. Not everyone wants to keep thier first minicooper lol. Maybe this is somthing tht can be included... Its 3/4 perfect",
        "Used to be one of my favorite games. Now with the update, there are no more option for multiplayer games or to speed up your purchases by watching videos. I realize that this is in part to have people download and play Version 2, which I do not care for. Some of us just prefer the original. Should leave well enough alone. Doubt I'll be playing this much more.",
        "Great game with very interesting features. However since CSR2 has been released, the game is starting to get abandoned I mean, today I checked the game in the play store and I found out it hasnt updated ever since. Still the same in the What's New tab and I bet that update was the one a year ago if im not mistaken. Pls NaturalMotion do not abandon the game that started it all! :( Notice this please I used to love this game before I played CSR2",
        "This game is one of the best on the market. With its stunning visuals, to its fast paced challenging gameplay, this is a app to have. There is only 1 thing I'd like, I want more tiers. I like beating bosses and winning huge amounts of currency. Add more and I will give it a solid 5. Great job!!!",
        "The game is excellent in every possible aspect. But I have no idea why is multiplayer gone. It was such an awesome and fantastic thing but now I ain't able to play it anymore. Though, if you did this, you probably had a reason for it, so I'm not going to convince you to hring it back, I know that's impossible. But'd atleast want to know why you did it, please answer.",
        "I think this game is great except the daily races for the bonus'. I do the races for the cash and win almost all of them but when the races are for the gold coins and I get perfect launch and gear changes yet I lose every single time. I think it's rigged and a load of trash. Needs to be re-looked at!"

        "I think everyone should have this game. It is one of the best games. Me and my friends love it we wish we new about it earlier than we did.I love it more that other people because I wash the show.I would recommend u to go with my advice but everyone has their own opinion. So if hate the game.it is ok. I understand.so of my friends say different things than me. I do not always like things people like so yeah this game is awesome to me but maybe not to you.",
        "Super reflective of the show, quite challenging but that's just part of the fun! Great gameplay especially watching the characters dance in the live shows. If you love the show and always wanted to be on it, this game gives you a little of that feel and satisfaction 😁 + the tech support is really friendly and responds quite timely",
        "As MUCH as I LOVE this game. It's very faulty when it comes to accounts. three times already my account has been locked due to getting new phone or accidentally trying to connect it to my Facebook. I lost over 9 weeks of hard work and dedication to this game and I refuse to attempt it a Fourth time. Uninstalling.",
        "Just when I thought there was no way you could make the gameplay of Candy Crush fun, this game taught me otherwise. This is insanely fun, not to mention the absolutely stellar soundtrack. 10/10 Would get addicted to this again.",
        "I get stuck on the loading screen for a long time. Waited half an hour and still no change. Definitely taking this off my tablet.",
        "I love the game.  My complain its right level a people level b there is no catch the points when I log on this morning they already millions I was 200k"

You try to inform them about these issues and noticed from several other players with same issues but they seem to not care or attempt to get back to you. If you search Facebook page you will see there replies to various players are just a bunch of emojis showing that they are just a bunch of immature people. Definitely do your research on this game before downloading. I don't want anyone else making the same mistake I made with this game.",

Oh LOOK A FEW SECONDS INTO THE GAME YOUR KICKIN OFF WITH FULL NUDITY PEOPLE FULL NUDITY WHAT A WASTE OF MY SPACE. Beep* uninstall NEVER INSTALLING FROM YOU IDIOTS AGAIN You STUPID RIPOFF OF EA Games. I MEAN WHO NAMES THEIR COMPANY GAME EA. Worst game EVER",
        "Well if you like games that play them selves then this game is for you. 2 stars are for graphics and storytelling in game. I would rather play old Diablo 1 than this game, you have almost no control in game, everything is auto! Auto walk, auto battle, auto sell, auto quest, auto feed pet. The only thing that breaks auto-play is messaging other players and talking to npc. Just make the game a movie its more than halfway there.",
        "Good game. can't say ive experienced the problems other players have pointed out thus far. It is crowded with lots of players but you're free to roam at your own pace. Automation in an MMO is silly but I don't mind. I also was kind of expecting Dark Souls not WoW as the aesthetic and tone. I suppose my advise would be just add more classes, more stuff to do, and encourage actual interaction with environment and players. But not a bad game all in all",
        "Not good if you want to play this game, there's always people trying to kill you if you interact with players with red on their name. Im trying to level up my character and some random people keep killing my character, you can't have a personal space while you trying to level up, I'm warning you, don't be decieved by the flashy trailer they'll do any for your wallet"

        "This game is quite relaxing and can be competitive at the same time. It's a good game for you to chill.  Hi gamegos, could you do something about the accidental purchase? Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

        "Enjoyed the game. Very fun and im actually spending which is rare for me.   I dont like the orb prices go up with each new arena. I wont be spending now im in in arena 4 those prices are just not worth it. Id also like the ability to save a few different decks. And make gold earning a bit easier its not balanced. Im in arena 4 and been saving gold for over a week not spending on anything opening orbs. And i still cant upgrade any of my cards.   Tbh as much as i enjoy the game. If i cant upgrade without spendig then ill wind up uninstalling eventually",
        "Love it! Very interesting and fun to play, but i have a suggestion. You should add some spells (Poison, Heal...). They don't have to be overpowered, just for slightly more fun gameplay! Also they should be regular cards (Heroes). And one more thing: bring some advatage to players that don't start first in the match, because it's easier to win when you are playing first.",
        "Very unique and fun strategy game. Easy to understand from the first game. Very forgiving to newcomers but if you want to get good, it takes planning and learning. Fun to pick up and play throughout the day. My only problem is that if you sit and play for more than a few minutes, you'll waste alot of orbs winning games. You can spend gems to free up slots, but I'd rather just not receive orbs until I have a free slot. Good game.",
        "I wish that your global rank was more intuitive and less complicated to acquire. Also on the achievement's it says that I can't get the last 2 stars on the found heroes however I have all that I can get. I also wish there was a pm option as the leader of a clan I want to give constructive criticism but not call them out in the chat.. other than that it fully deserved the 5 star.. thanks for makeing this and keep smashing!!😋",
        "The game itself its good, but lack of fun. To upgrade cards you need money which is hard to get in the game and from the clan. In free chest and common orbs you never get any rare cards and money is too less. Would be fun if the cards could be developed faster and if they would have a counter attack possibility when you upgrade it to certain level. You could implement a coop when each plyer choose 2 cards from deck or something similar. In addition I would change which player starts, should be based on the deck strenght. I would also implement the position of the cards on the field and which card is in front and which card in the back, by that you need to start a bit more strategic. Hope that something happens with the gameplay soon, before more players leave. Good luck",
        "Love the game. Really fun to play and balanced so even non paying players can do well. One complaint I have is the new addition of zombie has a bug, when hitting a buffed opponent the poison touch doesnt replace the buff. Please fix this issue."

        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

        "Honestly I was really surprised just how much this game impressed me. Fluid and easy controls to play or even to idle if that's your fancy. Constant events and everything is in a cutesy style with tons of favorites from the series",
        "This game is OK. But it's a bit confusing. And the whole, only using two characters this sucks. I can see there is some clash thing where you can use 6 of ur crew instead of random poor level characters but you can only do that for some special evet stuff once a month or something which seems stupid. I want that option all the time. Since most of the time nobody is trying to do the same level I am so I get bad bots and can't complete it. Sucks big time",
        "This rating is for the \"new\" update.... and \"revamp\" constant crashes and loss of Rainbow coins so far about 30. error s132  is ridiculous soft locking and general lag everywhere. This was a pretty good game now it's just meh.",
        "Just started playing and already starts lagging on loading screen. The lagging gets worse on missions. Not sure if I would want to continue playing based on my experience with the game",
        "The latest patch is a big improvement, but the pairing system need major work, most low level dungeons couldn't find players, and the changes to have to farm berries is a bit silly, I mean after farming character coins, skill levels, enhancement materials, now you are going to make people farm berries? That just kills any fun left in the game",
        "Hopefully the developers don't disregard this but I played through the tutorial and as soon as I got to the menu where I saw a Luffy on the ship the game crashed and now will repeatedly crash"

I asked them if I uninstalled and then cleanly reinstalled it, would I have my gun that I PAID FOR. That was the last of the conversation. Would have recommended this to anyone until now. For 3 weeks I have tried to reach them and have gotten nothing. So, HELL NO, I would NOT recommend this to anyone.",

Also I completed a daily task and did not receive my grenade. But other than that I love this game.. just needs those things to work! And maybe if I could get those things it would be nice!",
        "Game is fun. A lot of oppurtunity to get gems if you have patience.. gameplay is really good. However too many ads.. if you offer the oppurtunity for people to watch ads to get gems then why throw in all the extra random ads that we are forced to watch? Also i sometiimes get ads appear that you cant get rid of unless you close the game and reopen it. For trhis i give it one star.. get rid of the ads and ill give it 5",
        "I have did a lot of promotions to get free gems and didn't get any! I think it's wrong that I have wasted my time on the false advertising for gems. If y'all can't honor the time people put into to get the gems... Then y'all need to take it down! Other than that, the game is fun",
        "Great game, but the offer wall with the gems sucks. I paid for an offer and did not receive my gems. Sent email to the app producer and they suggested i contact other people. The problem has still not been corrected. So beware of offer wall. Dont waste your money!",
        "Usually don't\"pay\" for games. Made a $9.99 in game purchase, went through. Started playing gun and upgrades along with remaining gems are now gone, after only two minutes of playing!! RIP off!! Took money and screwed me!! Will contact my bank if not remedy. Theft of service!! UPDATE 3/8/18 STILL NO REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER! WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY A D GAME GLITCHES AND SHUTS OFF TAKING ANY PROGRESS! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! UPDATE 3/18/18  STILL NO WORD OR REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER!!! SCAM!!!!!"

After 2-3 years, getting a mid range mobile, I installed the game once again to try it on my new android & guess what, it WORKED Flawlessly! (On Moto G5 plus) and also, thanks a lot for giving me Rewards as a returning user back to Kritika. Love you guys, you are awesome. Keep developing XD(Request: like orders & chaos 2, please try to give a open world look) thanks once again.",

        "The game keeps kicking me out everytime i play. I cant play because the game crashes it takes me out of the game fix that and i will give it all stars it also gives me errors in the game itself for examples stamina error and free draw error I stopped playing the game because it kicks me out to much. This game crashes for android any android phone I don't understand.",
        "Server Issue!!!  Please fix your server! I'm really angry/pressured play your game! Especially event time. My connection it's really great! But why i'm always disconnected during play your game. The game is good, only the server. If you guys want people continue play your game. Do something about this. I hopefully, this problem fix as soon as possible!.",
        "A good game but can not download the latest patch after updating. I am a VIP and leader of a guild so this is troubling so until this issue is fixed the game gets just a star from me. The game has gotten worse tried to play after creating a new character and the game crashed on me, seriously gamevil you are slipping and it's a shame"

        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘"

At one point almost 3 years ago I quit playing because I lost all of my equipment and I guess somewhere in the 2 years they finally got to my request although I never really got all of my stuff back. I am considering quitting for good at this point because I am spending money on this game and no one ever responds to my issues. BUYER BEWARE!"

        "With daily events and online 3v3 matches; not to mention the addicitve meat farm and egg hatching. It's another GREAT game for the digimon fans, both new and old, to enjoy!   On a side note: I do wish they would add abit more to/continue the \"story mode\" but add abit of a cpu challenge to it.",
        "I love this game, I've been on almost everyday. It looks great, there are many Digivolution paths to take, and battling is a ton of fun. My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it's pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an \"ho\" or \"is\", and for some reason the word \"ready\" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.",
        "It's a good game, really easy to play and yoy get the hang off it but one of my biggest complaint is the grind! The whole game is about grinding to get good digimon but the drop rates are so freaking low! The game would be more enjoyable if the rates were higher. I don't want to be spending so much time for me to save up stamina just for me to use it in seconds and get nothing. Hopefully they change it if not then this game is probably going to be forgotten soon",
        "Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one",
        "The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else's hosted co-op game they're gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.",
        "Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I'm working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I'm looking forward to the next update."

The worst is even if I change the interface to left handed before a dual the game automatically changed the interface to right hand. And after a dual starts there is no way to access the setting to change to left hand. Please fix it! It's like forcing a left handed person to write with his right hand. I don't play duals anymore because of this problem. And I know if I don't play duals I won't get anywhere in this game. Be considerate please and fix it",
        "I love this game and the graphics are really neat but, there are a few bugs that seriously need of fixing. For starters, when I'm in the middle of a duel, it will straight up just kick me off and it will exit the game completely...its very frustrating. Second, why when someone is doing the duel, the opponent gets an extra 20 seconds to complete it?? I have won so many duels but since they get an extra 20 seconds, they tend to beat me when clearly I was ahead when the duel was actually over...please fix this. I really do love this game but it needs debugged to be a badass game."

        "i really liked the game it has everything to be best game. But dont be soo greedy. please make some more events and make some balance in duel or whatever because of course i cant win against someone like 45lvl when I'm 30 no? And the summoning rate is low mystery amulets are only one for a week lol i think it will take 10 years to get ssr for me. I dont want to leave this game please make something thanks you.",
        "It's a beautifully made game with a good story line involved. Sure it can be pay to win and all that, but nothing that a bit of hard work can't catch up to.  The controls are easy enough to understand and the combat system is just as simple. It does offer a few unique things such as the shared resource for bigger and better attacks, but it only adds to the depth of the combat system. All in all it's a good game and well thought out.",
        "I loved the game when I played the beta. Turn based rpg with different parables within the story mode. Unique unit designs. I cant get very far with the game because the audio echoes itself to the point where its almost hard to understand what is happening. Its a good thing there is subtitles. The game prides itself on its audio aspect by recommending \"use earphones for best experience\" before starting, and I would really love to hear the game.",
        "I used to love this game hence  I moved to the English server... having played on the Chinese server, I noticed the drop rate for this server is super low. Also the packages in the game ate way overpriced. Some skins in the Chinese server are free (ie moonlight blossom yuki onna) whereas in NA server you have to pay to get it. Honestly if the playing field is equal between the NA and the Asia server were equal, I'll stay in the NA server. Right now I'm going to move back to the Asia server even tho I can barely read the story.",
        "I love absolutely everything about this game. Its perfect...accept for one very big detail. Sadly, the characters that have unique and strategic skills are amazingly fun but will never amount to anything in pvp. The good characters are all too easy to play with and it becomes dull due to the lack of thought it takes to win. PVP is a disaster in gameplay and matchmaking. Otherwise, this game is very good.",
        "It's a fantastic game. It would be nice to lock actions so when you're on auto you don't waste orbs. You can pay alot to get more summons but it's all about grinding out the materials and taking the time to level up the guys you want. Would recommend for anyone who loves a good farm/grind game."

Sometimes I get matched with people with 2 to 3 times my health and they also have more defense so it's as if they have even more plus can 2 shot me.",
        "It's not stable while playing, it says all the time network issue but, My net speed has 75 Mbps, still having problems while playing this superb game.  Graphics is good Controllers are best.  During phone calls , we lose the match haha usually.",
        "Good game  Except for the constant updates and also why when i use a breaker on someone(example i use laura shiba) and as she hits with her sword the strike move my opponent does still seems to overpower it..wheres the ethic in that? Lost many a battle due to this silly glitch..sort it out!! Once an attack has been made and is hitting the opponent regardless of priority moves it should still count!!",
        "Good graphics. I really wish you could sell rangers and monsters that you don't want. It is way too unorganized for me having all these warriors with flashing buttons saying UPGRADE, when I don't want to waste my coins and crystals on warriors I'm never gonna fight with.",
        "Its to much of a gamble. For example i had a match were i started of with block, defense, block. And my opponent had from the looks a breaker, breaker, attack. I got freaking trashed in seconds. Thats the biggest issue for me and like some people leaders are f@#$*** ridiculously powerful. Needs more balance",
        "I have been a power rangers fan for years until the movie came out i loved this game its detailed the controls are great and my favorite ranger of all times is Tommy Oliver the green ranger white ranger and red zeo/turbo rangers and finally the black dino ranger"

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

        "I'm glad that you've finally thrown in 5v5. It's a lot of fun.  I'm aware you're trying to do your own thing as far as mobas go but I'd appreciate it if you'd consider adding a way to set up your own build before entering que. Many mobas do the same and I enjoy putting my own spin on builds without having to sit in the shop menu in game for 30+ seconds attempting to adjust everything from the standard builds.  Just a thought.  Thanks for this amazing game. =)",
        "The game is pretty good and the 5vs5 was the update I have been waiting for. Very easy to play nice graphics and controls are easy as well. But since the update 3.1 I have been getting bad pings but my internet is pretty good above 5 mbps constant an bing are well below 50. So have been getting thumbs down for rude pings. Kindly check i have been playing this gane for almost 2 years now. I dont want to remove the games.",
        "I've playing vg since its been 2 years before 5v5 update. After the updates i was start matching up time was taking pretty long and when it start to play the screen doesn't show up, after that it return to vg homescreen. Vanglory is one of my favourite game in these years and i don't want to take it off from my device. Try to fix the issue pls.thx",
        "Couldn't get free rewards for halycon, I clicked on them and it did nothing. I also had a rare mystery chest key and When I clicked to use it, it did nothing, not even get rid of the key. I had to reinstall and it still didn't work, please, help. I also never got that free chest for creating a profile. Very much appreciated if you help. I also don't know how to claim my five free heroes and one skin .-. And it shows I have no wins, which I do, but please, this really needs to be fixed!! I'm sure it's not just me who is having this problem. I also can't open my EPIC mystery chest, even though I have a key. Fix this.",
        "Nice gameplay, very good looking graphic for a MOBA game, on phone obviously. Very nice and comfortable controls. Impressive multiplayer and, fighting system. But The only problem i found is sometimes i still disconnecting from games due to low internet connection, but i got a solid 10MBps speed. I hope Super Evil MC quickly fixes this up. Really irritating when im fighting with enemy hero and you just \"pop\" disconnected. The others features are just fine.",
        "50 mbps connection with 47 pings tested during gameplay. Every time i start vainglory 5v5, works well. 10 mins in the ping goes to 30000 ms. I close the game and go to speedtest to check if my network works fine. ITS BEEN WORKING GREAT THE WHOLE TIME. i get back on the game and the ping is still 30000 ms till it goes back to normal after 5 mins. 5 MINS LOST. and after the game is over? DESERTER! do not push updates when your servers cant handle it. Its been happening to many players but they keep on thinking its their nets fault. Smh..."

        "I was having so much fun with this app today after the updated it on my S3 Galaxy tablet! Seriously!! This is dope! I can't wait to level up my grade from 3 & move forward to grade 5! When I watched the ATIS video tutorial,  I was blown away! It seems that \"Expert Server\" is becoming much more awesome with their new feature added in the server!! I really can't wait to get there! This is awesome update FDS!  Great job!  Keep it up! 😊😎👍👍👌👌🙌🙌",
        "This is truly a step up over your average plane simulation games. With Global release and many changes that have taken place it truly is the best out there.  My only gripe is that there is not enough focus on African Airlines. The new update has totally been focused on American and European Airlines. Most African airlines already have aircraft listed in Infinite Flight but yet aren't added. Sad really, hence the 4 stars",
        "Its good to hear that ur asking for our feedback. First of all let me tell that u guys are doing a superb job...keep it up and lots of love to u all who developed this simulator. One request to the admins that atleast reply to what we are asking, not exactly at the same time but take ur time and reply.. previously i had asked about adding liveries to 777 300 er model no one replied or even acknowledged that ur reply has been received. I hope to get a reply here atleast.  I would like to know when u will add A350 and more liveries in 777-300er model ( would love to see air india, jet airways, china southern, china eastern, jal, ana, korean air, alitalia).. please add this liveries.. it will be awesome",
        "If you love flight or you're a total aviation geek like myself. Infinite Flight is the app for you. Take a chance and fly anywhere around the world with dozen of aircraft for your choosing. You won't regret it. What are you waiting for ? Stop reading this and install 😁",
        "Played this game since the beginning, one of the biggest updates has only been made to those who have to pay an extortionate amount.  Feel robbed really and the fact I can't play the game offline, seriously? ffs what a waste.",
        "Well this is a bit atrocious. I feel entirely missold, was shown this app with the ability to fly pretty much from and to anywhere on the planet. I even had it on a previous phone and did such. Now I buy it and oh guess what? It was updated so one can't fly from one city to another, let alone another country. I mean it's pretty pointless at this point, don't think I can justify the additional £75 (per year) to enable me to actually use this and salvage some fun out of it -_-   Tl;Dr? I almost want my £5 back bc it was used for about 5 minutes - may as well build paper planes as they go further."
